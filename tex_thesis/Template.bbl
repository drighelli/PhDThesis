  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder
  that is associated with genetic risk factors. Most human disease-associated
  single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are not located in genes but rather
  are in regulatory regions that control gene expression. The function of
  regulatory regions is determined through epigenetic mechanisms. Parallels
  between the cellular basis of development and the formation of long-term
  memory have long been recognized, particularly the role of epigenetic
  mechanisms in both processes. We analyzed how learning alters chromatin
  accessibility in the mouse hippocampus using a new high-throughput sequencing
  bioinformatics strategy we call DEScan (differential enrichment scan).
  DEScan, which enabled the analysis of data from epigenomic experiments
  containing multiple replicates, revealed changes in chromatin accessibility
  at 2365 regulatory regions-most of which were promoters. Learning-regulated
  promoters were active during forebrain development in mice and were enriched
  in epigenetic modifications indicative of bivalent promoters. These promoters
  were disproportionally intronic, showed a complex relationship with gene
  expression and alternative splicing during memory consolidation and
  retrieval, and were enriched in the data set relative to known ASD risk
  genes. Genotyping in a clinical cohort within one of these promoters (SHANK3
  promoter 6) revealed that the SNP rs6010065 was associated with ASD. Our data
  support the idea that learning recapitulates development at the epigenetic
  level and demonstrate that behaviorally induced epigenetic changes in mice
  can highlight regulatory regions relevant to brain disorders in patients.%

  SUMMARY: The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format is a generic alignment
  format for storing read alignments against reference sequences, supporting
  short and long reads (up to 128 Mbp) produced by different sequencing
  platforms. It is flexible in style, compact in size, efficient in random
  access and is the format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project
  are released. SAMtools implements various utilities for post-processing
  alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing, variant caller and alignment
  viewer, and thus provides universal tools for processing read alignments.

  BACKGROUND Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput
  sequencing (ChIP-seq) or ChIP followed by genome tiling array analysis
  (ChIP-chip) have become standard technologies for genome-wide identification
  of DNA-binding protein target sites. A number of algorithms have been
  developed in parallel that allow identification of binding sites from
  ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip datasets and subsequent visualization in the University
  of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser as custom annotation tracks.
  However, summarizing these tracks can be a daunting task, particularly if
  there are a large number of binding sites or the binding sites are
  distributed widely across the genome. RESULTS We have developed ChIPpeakAnno
  as a Bioconductor package within the statistical programming environment R to
  facilitate batch annotation of enriched peaks identified from ChIP-seq,
  ChIP-chip, cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) or any experiments
  resulting in a large number of enriched genomic regions. The binding sites
  annotated with ChIPpeakAnno can be viewed easily as a table, a pie chart or
  plotted in histogram form, i.e., the distribution of distances to the nearest
  genes for each set of peaks. In addition, we have implemented functionalities
  for determining the significance of overlap between replicates or binding
  sites among transcription factors within a complex, and for drawing Venn
  diagrams to visualize the extent of the overlap between replicates.
  Furthermore, the package includes functionalities to retrieve sequences
  flanking putative binding sites for PCR amplification, cloning, or motif
  discovery, and to identify Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with adjacent
  genes. CONCLUSIONS ChIPpeakAnno enables batch annotation of the binding sites
  identified from ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip, CAGE or any technology that results in a
  large number of enriched genomic regions within the statistical programming
  environment R. Allowing users to pass their own annotation data such as a
  different Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) preparation and a dataset from
  literature, or existing annotation packages, such as GenomicFeatures and
  BSgenome, provides flexibility. Tight integration to the biomaRt package
  enables up-to-date annotation retrieval from the BioMart database.%

  The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) project was initiated in response to the
  growing demand for a public repository for high-throughput gene expression
  data. GEO provides a flexible and open design that facilitates submission,
  storage and retrieval of heterogeneous data sets from high-throughput gene
  expression and genomic hybridization experiments. GEO is not intended to
  replace in house gene expression databases that benefit from coherent data
  sets, and which are constructed to facilitate a particular analytic method,
  but rather complement these by acting as a tertiary, central data
  distribution hub. The three central data entities of GEO are platforms,
  samples and series, and were designed with gene expression and genomic
  hybridization experiments in mind. A platform is, essentially, a list of
  probes that define what set of molecules may be detected. A sample describes
  the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform
  used to generate its molecular abundance data. A series organizes samples
  into the meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. The GEO repository
  is publicly accessible through the World Wide Web at
  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo.%

  research community. The resource supports archiving of raw data, processed
  data and metadata which are indexed, cross-linked and searchable. All data
  are freely available for download in a variety of formats. GEO also provides
  several web-based tools and strategies to assist users to query, analyse and
  visualize data. This article reports current status and recent database

  MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a
  challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript
  structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput
  of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer
  from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and
  mapping biases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To align our large
  ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we
  developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software
  based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses
  sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays
  followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other
  aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the
  human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest
  12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and
  precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions,
  STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts,
  and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454
  sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we
  experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an
  80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping
  strategy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is
  implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source software
  distributed under GPLv3 license and can be downloaded from
  http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/.%
