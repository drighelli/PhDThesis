  We compare methods for filtering RNA-seq lowexpression genes and investigate
  the effect of filtering on detection of differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs). Although RNA-seq technology has improved the dynamic range of gene
  expression quantification, low-expression genes may be indistinguishable from
  sampling noise. The presence of noisy, low-expression genes can decrease the
  sensitivity of detecting DEGs. Thus, identification and filtering of these
  low-expression genes may improve DEG detection sensitivity. Using the SEQC
  benchmark dataset, we investigate the effect of different filtering methods
  on DEG detection sensitivity. Moreover, we investigate the effect of RNA-seq
  pipelines on optimal filtering thresholds. Results indicate that the
  filtering threshold that maximizes the total number of DEGs closely
  corresponds to the threshold that maximizes DEG detection sensitivity.
  Transcriptome reference annotation, expression quantification method, and DEG
  detection method are statistically significant RNA-seq pipeline factors that
  affect the optimal filtering threshold.%

  http://bioinfo.cipf.es/aconesa Introduction Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
  technologies have brought a revolution to research in genome and genome
  regulation. One of the most breaking applications of NGS is in transcriptome
  analysis. RNA-seq has revealed exciting new data on gene models, alternative
  splicing and extra-genic expression. Also RNA-seq permits the quantification
  of gene expression across a large dynamic range and with more reproducibility
  than microarrays. Several methods for the assessment of differential
  expression from count data have been proposed but biases associated to
  transcript length and transcript frequency distributions have been reported.
  It is still not clear how much sequencing reads should be generated in a
  RNA-seq experiment to obtain reliable results and what's exactly being
  detected. In general we observed that many RNA-seq datasets have not reached
  saturation for detection of expressed genes and that the relative proportion
  of different transcript biotypes changes with increasing sequencing depth. In
  this work we investigate the effect that library size has on the assessment
  of differential expression on different aspects of the selected genes. We
  show that current statistical methods suffer from a strong dependency of
  their significant calls on the number of mapped reads considered and proposed
  a novel differential expression methodology â€“ NOISeq1- that is robust to
  the amount of reads. Results NOISeq is a non-parametric approach for the
  differential expression analysis of RNseq-data. NOISeq creates a null or
  noise distribution of count changes by comparing the number of reads of each
  gene in samples within the same condition. This reference distribution is
  then used to assess whether the change in count number between two conditions
  for a given gene is likely to be part of the noise or represents a true
  differential expression. Two variants of the method are implemented:
  NOISeq-real uses replicates, when available, to compute the noise
  distribution and, NOISeq-sim simulates them in absence of replication. We
  compared our method with edgeR2, DESeq3, baySeq4 and Fisher Exact Test (FET)
  using three different experimental datasets. Results are presented for MAQC
  experiment where the transcriptome of brain and Universal Human Reference
  (HUR) samples were sequenced at about 45 million Solexa reads each. We first
  determined that although protein-coding gene is the most abundant transcript
  type within differential expression calls for all methodologies, other RNA
  types, such as processed-transcript, pseudogenes and lincRNAs are readily
  detected. NOISeq dected comparatively more protein-coding genes than other
  methods that called significant a considerable number of non-coding and small
  RNA transcripts. Additionally, all comparing methods except FET greatly
  increased the number of detected (non-coding) genes as sequencing depth
  raised while NOISeq showed a constant pattern. Also these other methods tend
  to select shorter genes and smaller fold change differences with the
  increasing amounts of reads. In general, parametric approaches selected much
  more genes than NOISeq, specially at high sequencing depth rates. When
  analyzing the functional content of these genes by functional enrichment
  analysis, we observed that the pool of genes detected both by NOISeq and the
  parametric methods where highly enriched in functional categories, while
  genes selected only by parametric methods did not. To check whether this
  differences were indicative of different false calls between methods, we used
  the RT-PCR data available at the MAQC project that contains 330 true positive
  and 83 true negative differentially expressed genes. Performance plots
  indicate that edgeR, DESeq, baySeq strongly increased the number of false
  calls with sequencing depth, while NOISeq was constant and low. On the
  contrary true discoveries were slightly better for these methods, presumably
  consequence of their large number of selected genes. FET showed in low false
  and true discovery rates, due to its general lower detection power.
  Conclusions We showed that most current RNA-seq statistical analysis methods
  fail to control the number of false discoveries as the size of the sequenced
  library increases. These false positive are mainly short, non- coding genes
  and/or genes with small fold changes. NOISeq, but adopting an empirical
  approach to model the null distribution of differential expression captures
  better the shape of noise in RNA-seq data, resulting in a sequencing-depth
  robust method for differential expression analysis. References 1. Tarazona

  Normalization of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data has proven essential to ensure
  accurate inference of expression levels. Here, we show that usual
  normalization approaches mostly account for sequencing depth and fail to
  correct for library preparation and other more complex unwanted technical
  effects. We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control Consortium
  (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the possibility of using them
  directly for normalization. We show that the spike-ins are not reliable
  enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based
  normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove
  unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by
  performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC
  spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more
  accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential
  expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods. In particular,
  RUV promises to be valuable for large collaborative projects involving
  multiple laboratories, technicians, and/or sequencing platforms.%

  The correct identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between
  specific conditions is a key in the understanding phenotypic variation.
  High-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the main option
  for these studies. Thus, the number of methods and softwares for differential
  expression analysis from RNA-Seq data also increased rapidly. However, there
  is no consensus about the most appropriate pipeline or protocol for
  identifying differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq data. This work
  presents an extended review on the topic that includes the evaluation of six
  methods of mapping reads, including pseudo-alignment and quasi-mapping and
  nine methods of differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq data. The
  adopted methods were evaluated based on real RNA-Seq data, using qRT-PCR data
  as reference (gold-standard). As part of the results, we developed a software
  that performs all the analysis presented in this work, which is freely
  available at https://github.com/costasilvati/consexpression. The results
  indicated that mapping methods have minimal impact on the final DEGs
  analysis, considering that adopted data have an annotated reference genome.
  Regarding the adopted experimental model, the DEGs identification methods
  that have more consistent results were the limma+voom, NOIseq and DESeq2.
  Additionally, the consensus among five DEGs identification methods guarantees
  a list of DEGs with great accuracy, indicating that the combination of
  different methods can produce more suitable results. The consensus option is
  also included for use in the available software.%

  In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the
  analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence

  require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for
  differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for

  MOTIVATION The widespread adoption of RNA-seq to quantitatively measure gene
  expression has increased the scope of sequencing experimental designs to
  include time-course experiments. maSigPro is an R package specifically suited
  for the analysis of time-course gene expression data, which was developed
  originally for microarrays and hence was limited in its application to count
  data. RESULTS We have updated maSigPro to support RNA-seq time series
  analysis by introducing generalized linear models in the algorithm to support
  the modeling of count data while maintaining the traditional functionalities
  of the package. We show a good performance of the maSigPro-GLM method in
  several simulated time-course scenarios and in a real experimental dataset.

  Read alignment is an ongoing challenge for the analysis of data from
  sequencing technologies. This article proposes an elegantly simple multi-seed
  strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping reads to a reference genome. The
  new strategy chooses the mapped genomic location for the read directly from
  the seeds. It uses a relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads)
  extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the optimal
  location. When the read length is {\textless}160 bp, overlapping subreads are
  used. More conventional alignment algorithms are then used to fill in
  detailed mismatch and indel information between the subreads that make up the
  winning voting block. The strategy is fast because the overall genomic
  location has already been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is
  sensitive because no individual subread is required to map exactly, nor are
  individual subreads constrained to map close by other subreads. It is
  accurate because the final location must be supported by several different
  subreads. The strategy extends easily to find exon junctions, by locating
  reads that contain sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same
  gene. It scales up efficiently for longer reads.%

  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder
  that is associated with genetic risk factors. Most human disease-associated
  single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are not located in genes but rather
  are in regulatory regions that control gene expression. The function of
  regulatory regions is determined through epigenetic mechanisms. Parallels
  between the cellular basis of development and the formation of long-term
  memory have long been recognized, particularly the role of epigenetic
  mechanisms in both processes. We analyzed how learning alters chromatin
  accessibility in the mouse hippocampus using a new high-throughput sequencing
  bioinformatics strategy we call DEScan (differential enrichment scan).
  DEScan, which enabled the analysis of data from epigenomic experiments
  containing multiple replicates, revealed changes in chromatin accessibility
  at 2365 regulatory regions-most of which were promoters. Learning-regulated
  promoters were active during forebrain development in mice and were enriched
  in epigenetic modifications indicative of bivalent promoters. These promoters
  were disproportionally intronic, showed a complex relationship with gene
  expression and alternative splicing during memory consolidation and
  retrieval, and were enriched in the data set relative to known ASD risk
  genes. Genotyping in a clinical cohort within one of these promoters (SHANK3
  promoter 6) revealed that the SNP rs6010065 was associated with ASD. Our data
  support the idea that learning recapitulates development at the epigenetic
  level and demonstrate that behaviorally induced epigenetic changes in mice
  can highlight regulatory regions relevant to brain disorders in patients.%

  Disruptions in local chromatin structure often indicate features of
  biological interest such as regulatory regions. We find that sonication of
  cross-linked chromatin, when combined with a size-selection step and
  massively parallel short-read sequencing, can be used as a method (Sono-Seq)
  to map locations of high chromatin accessibility in promoter regions.
  Sono-Seq sites frequently correspond to actively transcribed promoter
  regions, as evidenced by their co-association with RNA Polymerase II ChIP
  regions, transcription start sites, histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation
  (H3K4me3) marks, and CpG islands; signals over other sites, such as those
  bound by the CTCF insulator, are also observed. The pattern of breakage by
  Sono-Seq overlaps with, but is distinct from, that observed for FAIRE and
  DNase I hypersensitive sites. Our results demonstrate that Sono-Seq can be a
  useful and simple method by which to map many local alterations in chromatin
  structure. Furthermore, our results provide insights into the mapping of
  binding sites by using ChIPâ€“Seq experiments and the value of reference
  samples that should be used in such experiments.%

  SUMMARY: The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format is a generic alignment
  format for storing read alignments against reference sequences, supporting
  short and long reads (up to 128 Mbp) produced by different sequencing
  platforms. It is flexible in style, compact in size, efficient in random
  access and is the format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project
  are released. SAMtools implements various utilities for post-processing
  alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing, variant caller and alignment
  viewer, and thus provides universal tools for processing read alignments.

  BACKGROUND Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput
  sequencing (ChIP-seq) or ChIP followed by genome tiling array analysis
  (ChIP-chip) have become standard technologies for genome-wide identification
  of DNA-binding protein target sites. A number of algorithms have been
  developed in parallel that allow identification of binding sites from
  ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip datasets and subsequent visualization in the University
  of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser as custom annotation tracks.
  However, summarizing these tracks can be a daunting task, particularly if
  there are a large number of binding sites or the binding sites are
  distributed widely across the genome. RESULTS We have developed ChIPpeakAnno
  as a Bioconductor package within the statistical programming environment R to
  facilitate batch annotation of enriched peaks identified from ChIP-seq,
  ChIP-chip, cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) or any experiments
  resulting in a large number of enriched genomic regions. The binding sites
  annotated with ChIPpeakAnno can be viewed easily as a table, a pie chart or
  plotted in histogram form, i.e., the distribution of distances to the nearest
  genes for each set of peaks. In addition, we have implemented functionalities
  for determining the significance of overlap between replicates or binding
  sites among transcription factors within a complex, and for drawing Venn
  diagrams to visualize the extent of the overlap between replicates.
  Furthermore, the package includes functionalities to retrieve sequences
  flanking putative binding sites for PCR amplification, cloning, or motif
  discovery, and to identify Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with adjacent
  genes. CONCLUSIONS ChIPpeakAnno enables batch annotation of the binding sites
  identified from ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip, CAGE or any technology that results in a
  large number of enriched genomic regions within the statistical programming
  environment R. Allowing users to pass their own annotation data such as a
  different Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) preparation and a dataset from
  literature, or existing annotation packages, such as GenomicFeatures and
  BSgenome, provides flexibility. Tight integration to the biomaRt package
  enables up-to-date annotation retrieval from the BioMart database.%

  The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) project was initiated in response to the
  growing demand for a public repository for high-throughput gene expression
  data. GEO provides a flexible and open design that facilitates submission,
  storage and retrieval of heterogeneous data sets from high-throughput gene
  expression and genomic hybridization experiments. GEO is not intended to
  replace in house gene expression databases that benefit from coherent data
  sets, and which are constructed to facilitate a particular analytic method,
  but rather complement these by acting as a tertiary, central data
  distribution hub. The three central data entities of GEO are platforms,
  samples and series, and were designed with gene expression and genomic
  hybridization experiments in mind. A platform is, essentially, a list of
  probes that define what set of molecules may be detected. A sample describes
  the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform
  used to generate its molecular abundance data. A series organizes samples
  into the meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. The GEO repository
  is publicly accessible through the World Wide Web at
  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo.%

  MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a
  challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript
  structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput
  of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer
  from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and
  mapping biases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To align our large
  ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we
  developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software
  based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses
  sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays
  followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other
  aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the
  human genome 550 million 2 Ã— 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest
  12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and
  precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions,
  STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts,
  and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454
  sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we
  experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an
  80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping
  strategy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is
  implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source software
  distributed under GPLv3 license and can be downloaded from
  http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/.%

  During the last 3 years, a number of approaches for the normalization of RNA
  sequencing data have emerged in the literature, differing both in the type of
  bias adjustment and in the statistical strategy adopted. However, as data
  continue to accumulate, there has been no clear consensus on the appropriate
  normalization method to be used or the impact of a chosen method on the
  downstream analysis. In this work, we focus on a comprehensive comparison of
  seven recently proposed normalization methods for the differential analysis
  of RNA-seq data, with an emphasis on the use of varied real and simulated
  datasets involving different species and experimental designs to represent
  data characteristics commonly observed in practice. Based on this comparison
  study, we propose practical recommendations on the appropriate normalization
  method to be used and its impact on the differential analysis of RNA-seq

  A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts
  from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse
  complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking
  variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological
  variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical
  variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes
  methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there
  are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such
  variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the
  Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates
  the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential
  expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression
  changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific
  variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed
  relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions
  de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to
  focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel
  computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting
  faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more
  convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted
  profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological
  variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical
  Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of
  assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods
  developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq
  applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation
  analyses.%

  The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the
  familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point
  out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing
  is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely
  rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent
  to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore,
  in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of
  the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple
  sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery
  rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the
  gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the
  appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.%

  new developments and documentation, serving as a portal to GO data. Users can
  perform GO enrichment analysis, and search the GO for terms, annotations to
