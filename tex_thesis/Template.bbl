    Ten years ago next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies appeared on the
  market. During the past decade, tremendous progress has been made in terms of
  speed, read length, and throughput, along with a sharp reduction in per-base
  cost. Together, these advances democratized NGS and paved the way for the
  development of a large number of novel NGS applications in basic science as
  well as in translational research areas such as clinical diagnostics,
  agrigenomics, and forensic science. Here we provide an overview of the
  evolution of NGS and discuss the most significant improvements in sequencing
  technologies and library preparation protocols. We also explore the current
  landscape of NGS applications and provide a perspective for future
  developments.%

    RNA-Seq is a recently developed approach to transcriptome profiling that
  uses deep-sequencing technologies. Studies using this method have already
  altered our view of the extent and complexity of eukaryotic transcriptomes.
  RNA-Seq also provides a far more precise measurement of levels of transcripts

    {\textless}p{\textgreater}In recent years, the introduction of massively
  parallel sequencing platforms for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) protocols,
  able to simultaneously sequence hundred thousand DNA fragments, dramatically
  changed the landscape of the genetics studies. RNA-Seq for transcriptome
  studies, Chip-Seq for DNA-proteins interaction, CNV-Seq for large genome
  nucleotide variations are only some of the intriguing new applications
  supported by these innovative platforms. Among them RNA-Seq is perhaps the
  most complex NGS application. Expression levels of specific genes,
  differential splicing, allele-specific expression of transcripts can be
  accurately determined by RNA-Seq experiments to address many
  biological-related issues. All these attributes are not readily achievable
  from previously widespread hybridization-based or tag sequence-based
  approaches. However, the unprecedented level of sensitivity and the large
  amount of available data produced by NGS platforms provide clear advantages
  as well as new challenges and issues. This technology brings the great power
  to make several new biological observations and discoveries, it also requires
  a considerable effort in the development of new bioinformatics tools to deal
  with these massive data files. The paper aims to give a survey of the RNA-Seq
  methodology, particularly focusing on the challenges that this application
  presents both from a biological and a bioinformatics point of
  view.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}%

    The availability of the human genome sequence has allowed identification of
  disease-causing mutations in many Mendelian disorders, and detection of
  significant associations of nucleotide polymorphisms to complex diseases and
  traits. Despite these progresses, finding the causative variations for most
  of the common diseases remains a complex task. Several studies have shown
  gene expression analyses provide a quite unbiased way to investigate complex
  traits and common disorders' pathogenesis. Therefore, whole-transcriptome
  analysis is increasingly acquiring a key role in the knowledge of mechanisms
  responsible for complex diseases. Hybridization-and tag-based technologies
  have elucidated the involvement of multiple genes and pathways in
  pathological conditions, providing insights into the expression of thousand
  of coding and noncoding RNAs, such as microRNAs. However, the introduction of
  Next-Generation Sequencing, particularly of RNA-Seq, has overcome some
  drawbacks of previously used technologies. Identifying, in a single
  experiment, potentially novel genes/exons and splice isoforms, RNA editing,
  fusion transcripts and allele-specific expression are some of its advantages.
  RNA-Seq has been fruitfully applied to study cancer and host-pathogens
  interactions, and it is taking first steps for studying neurodegenerative
  diseases (ND) as well as neuropsychiatric diseases. In addition, it is
  emerging as a very powerful tool to study quantitative trait loci associated
  with gene expression in complex diseases. This paper provides an overview on
  gene expression profiling of complex diseases, with emphasis on RNA-Seq, its
  advantages over conventional technologies for studying cancer and ND, and for
  linking nucleotide variations to gene expression changes, also discussing its
  limitations.%

    Genome-wide measurements of protein-DNA interactions and transcriptomes are
  increasingly done by deep DNA sequencing methods (ChIP-seq and RNA-seq). The
  power and richness of these counting-based measurements comes at the cost of
  routinely handling tens to hundreds of millions of reads. Whereas early
  adopters necessarily developed their own custom computer code to analyze the
  first ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets, a new generation of more sophisticated
  algorithms and software tools are emerging to assist in the analysis phase of
  these projects. Here we describe the multilayered analyses of ChIP-seq and
  RNA-seq datasets, discuss the software packages currently available to
  perform tasks at each layer and describe some upcoming challenges and
  features for future analysis tools. We also discuss how software choices and
  uses are affected by specific aspects of the underlying biology and data
  structure, including genome size, positional clustering of transcription
  factor binding sites, transcript discovery and expression quantification.%

    The vertebrate body is built on a metameric organization which consists of
  a repetition of functionally equivalent units, each comprising a vertebra,
  its associated muscles, peripheral nerves and blood vessels. This periodic
  pattern is established during embryogenesis by the somitogenesis process.
  Somites are generated in a rhythmic fashion from the presomitic mesoderm and
  they subsequently differentiate to give rise to the vertebrae and skeletal
  muscles of the body. Somitogenesis has been very actively studied in the
  chick embryo since the 19th century and many of the landmark experiments that
  led to our current understanding of the vertebrate segmentation process have
  been performed in this organism. Somite formation involves an oscillator, the
  segmentation clock whose periodic signal is converted into the periodic array
  of somite boundaries by a spacing mechanism relying on a traveling threshold
  of FGF signaling regressing in concert with body axis extension. ?? 2004

    DNase-seq is primarily used to identify nucleosome-depleted DNase I
  hypersensitive (DHS) sites genome-wide that correspond to active regulatory
  elements. However, ≈ 40 yr ago it was demonstrated that DNase I also
  digests with a ≈ 10-bp periodicity around nucleosomes matching the exposure
  of the DNA minor groove as it wraps around histones. Here, we use DNase-seq
  data from 49 samples representing diverse cell types to reveal this digestion
  pattern at individual loci and predict genomic locations where nucleosome
  rotational positioning, the orientation of DNA with respect to the histone
  surface, is stably maintained. We call these regions DNase I annotated
  regions of nucleosome stability (DARNS). Compared to MNase-seq experiments,
  we show DARNS correspond well to annotated nucleosomes. Interestingly, many
  DARNS are positioned over only one side of annotated nucleosomes, suggesting
  that the periodic digestion pattern attenuates over the nucleosome dyad.
  DARNS reproduce the arrangement of nucleosomes around transcription start
  sites and are depleted at ubiquitous DHS sites. We also generated DARNS from
  multiple lymphoblast cell line (LCL) samples. We found that LCL DARNS were
  enriched at DHS sites present in most of the original 49 samples but absent
  in LCLs, while multi-cell-type DARNS were enriched at LCL-specific DHS sites.
  This indicates that variably open DHS sites are often occupied by
  rotationally stable nucleosomes in cell types where the DHS site is closed.
  DARNS provide additional information about precise DNA orientation within
  individual nucleosomes not available from other nucleosome positioning assays
  and contribute to understanding the role of chromatin in gene regulation.%

    We describe an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing
  (ATAC-seq), based on direct in vitro transposition of sequencing adaptors
  into native chromatin, as a rapid and sensitive method for integrative
  epigenomic analysis. ATAC-seq captures open chromatin sites using a simple
  two-step protocol with 500-50,000 cells and reveals the interplay between
  genomic locations of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins, individual
  nucleosomes and chromatin compaction at nucleotide resolution. We discovered
  classes of DNA-binding factors that strictly avoided, could tolerate or
  tended to overlap with nucleosomes. Using ATAC-seq maps of human CD4(+) T
  cells from a proband obtained on consecutive days, we demonstrated the
  feasibility of analyzing an individual's epigenome on a timescale compatible
  with clinical decision-making.%

    Next-generation sequencing technologies generate millions of short sequence
  reads, which are usually aligned to a reference genome. In many applications,
  the key information required for downstream analysis is the number of reads
  mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene. The
  process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read summarization is
  required for a great variety of genomic analyses but has so far received
  relatively little attention in the literature. We present featureCounts, a
  read summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either
  RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts implements highly
  efficient chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques. It is
  considerably faster than existing methods (by an order of magnitude for
  gene-level summarization) and requires far less computer memory. It works
  with either single or paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options
  appropriate for different sequencing applications. featureCounts is available
  under GNU General Public License as part of the Subread

    We compare methods for filtering RNA-seq lowexpression genes and
  investigate the effect of filtering on detection of differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs). Although RNA-seq technology has improved the dynamic range of
  gene expression quantification, low-expression genes may be indistinguishable
  from sampling noise. The presence of noisy, low-expression genes can decrease
  the sensitivity of detecting DEGs. Thus, identification and filtering of
  these low-expression genes may improve DEG detection sensitivity. Using the
  SEQC benchmark dataset, we investigate the effect of different filtering
  methods on DEG detection sensitivity. Moreover, we investigate the effect of
  RNA-seq pipelines on optimal filtering thresholds. Results indicate that the
  filtering threshold that maximizes the total number of DEGs closely
  corresponds to the threshold that maximizes DEG detection sensitivity.
  Transcriptome reference annotation, expression quantification method, and DEG
  detection method are statistically significant RNA-seq pipeline factors that
  affect the optimal filtering threshold.%

    http://bioinfo.cipf.es/aconesa Introduction Next Generation Sequencing
  (NGS) technologies have brought a revolution to research in genome and genome
  regulation. One of the most breaking applications of NGS is in transcriptome
  analysis. RNA-seq has revealed exciting new data on gene models, alternative
  splicing and extra-genic expression. Also RNA-seq permits the quantification
  of gene expression across a large dynamic range and with more reproducibility
  than microarrays. Several methods for the assessment of differential
  expression from count data have been proposed but biases associated to
  transcript length and transcript frequency distributions have been reported.
  It is still not clear how much sequencing reads should be generated in a
  RNA-seq experiment to obtain reliable results and what's exactly being
  detected. In general we observed that many RNA-seq datasets have not reached
  saturation for detection of expressed genes and that the relative proportion
  of different transcript biotypes changes with increasing sequencing depth. In
  this work we investigate the effect that library size has on the assessment
  of differential expression on different aspects of the selected genes. We
  show that current statistical methods suffer from a strong dependency of
  their significant calls on the number of mapped reads considered and proposed
  a novel differential expression methodology – NOISeq1- that is robust to
  the amount of reads. Results NOISeq is a non-parametric approach for the
  differential expression analysis of RNseq-data. NOISeq creates a null or
  noise distribution of count changes by comparing the number of reads of each
  gene in samples within the same condition. This reference distribution is
  then used to assess whether the change in count number between two conditions
  for a given gene is likely to be part of the noise or represents a true
  differential expression. Two variants of the method are implemented:
  NOISeq-real uses replicates, when available, to compute the noise
  distribution and, NOISeq-sim simulates them in absence of replication. We
  compared our method with edgeR2, DESeq3, baySeq4 and Fisher Exact Test (FET)
  using three different experimental datasets. Results are presented for MAQC
  experiment where the transcriptome of brain and Universal Human Reference
  (HUR) samples were sequenced at about 45 million Solexa reads each. We first
  determined that although protein-coding gene is the most abundant transcript
  type within differential expression calls for all methodologies, other RNA
  types, such as processed-transcript, pseudogenes and lincRNAs are readily
  detected. NOISeq dected comparatively more protein-coding genes than other
  methods that called significant a considerable number of non-coding and small
  RNA transcripts. Additionally, all comparing methods except FET greatly
  increased the number of detected (non-coding) genes as sequencing depth
  raised while NOISeq showed a constant pattern. Also these other methods tend
  to select shorter genes and smaller fold change differences with the
  increasing amounts of reads. In general, parametric approaches selected much
  more genes than NOISeq, specially at high sequencing depth rates. When
  analyzing the functional content of these genes by functional enrichment
  analysis, we observed that the pool of genes detected both by NOISeq and the
  parametric methods where highly enriched in functional categories, while
  genes selected only by parametric methods did not. To check whether this
  differences were indicative of different false calls between methods, we used
  the RT-PCR data available at the MAQC project that contains 330 true positive
  and 83 true negative differentially expressed genes. Performance plots
  indicate that edgeR, DESeq, baySeq strongly increased the number of false
  calls with sequencing depth, while NOISeq was constant and low. On the
  contrary true discoveries were slightly better for these methods, presumably
  consequence of their large number of selected genes. FET showed in low false
  and true discovery rates, due to its general lower detection power.
  Conclusions We showed that most current RNA-seq statistical analysis methods
  fail to control the number of false discoveries as the size of the sequenced
  library increases. These false positive are mainly short, non- coding genes
  and/or genes with small fold changes. NOISeq, but adopting an empirical
  approach to model the null distribution of differential expression captures
  better the shape of noise in RNA-seq data, resulting in a sequencing-depth
  robust method for differential expression analysis. References 1. Tarazona

    Normalization of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data has proven essential to
  ensure accurate inference of expression levels. Here, we show that usual
  normalization approaches mostly account for sequencing depth and fail to
  correct for library preparation and other more complex unwanted technical
  effects. We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control Consortium
  (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the possibility of using them
  directly for normalization. We show that the spike-ins are not reliable
  enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based
  normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove
  unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by
  performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC
  spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more
  accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential
  expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods. In particular,
  RUV promises to be valuable for large collaborative projects involving
  multiple laboratories, technicians, and/or sequencing platforms.%

    The correct identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between
  specific conditions is a key in the understanding phenotypic variation.
  High-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the main option
  for these studies. Thus, the number of methods and softwares for differential
  expression analysis from RNA-Seq data also increased rapidly. However, there
  is no consensus about the most appropriate pipeline or protocol for
  identifying differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq data. This work
  presents an extended review on the topic that includes the evaluation of six
  methods of mapping reads, including pseudo-alignment and quasi-mapping and
  nine methods of differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq data. The
  adopted methods were evaluated based on real RNA-Seq data, using qRT-PCR data
  as reference (gold-standard). As part of the results, we developed a software
  that performs all the analysis presented in this work, which is freely
  available at https://github.com/costasilvati/consexpression. The results
  indicated that mapping methods have minimal impact on the final DEGs
  analysis, considering that adopted data have an annotated reference genome.
  Regarding the adopted experimental model, the DEGs identification methods
  that have more consistent results were the limma+voom, NOIseq and DESeq2.
  Additionally, the consensus among five DEGs identification methods guarantees
  a list of DEGs with great accuracy, indicating that the combination of
  different methods can produce more suitable results. The consensus option is
  also included for use in the available software.%

    In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the

    MOTIVATION The widespread adoption of RNA-seq to quantitatively measure
  gene expression has increased the scope of sequencing experimental designs to
  include time-course experiments. maSigPro is an R package specifically suited
  for the analysis of time-course gene expression data, which was developed
  originally for microarrays and hence was limited in its application to count
  data. RESULTS We have updated maSigPro to support RNA-seq time series
  analysis by introducing generalized linear models in the algorithm to support
  the modeling of count data while maintaining the traditional functionalities
  of the package. We show a good performance of the maSigPro-GLM method in
  several simulated time-course scenarios and in a real experimental dataset.

    Motivation: Digital gene expression (DGE) technologies measure gene
  expression by counting sequence tags. They are sensitive technologies for
  measuring gene expression on a genomic scale, without the need for prior
  knowledge of the genome sequence. As the cost of sequencing DNA decreases,
  the number of DGE datasets is expected to grow
  dramatically.$\backslash$nVarious tests of differential expression have been
  proposed for replicated DGE data using binomial, Poisson, negative binomial
  or pseudo-likelihood (PL) models for the counts, but none of the these are
  usable when the number of replicates is very small.$\backslash$nResults: We
  develop tests using the negative binomial distribution to model
  overdispersion relative to the Poisson, and use conditional weighted
  likelihood to moderate the level of overdispersion across genes. Not only is
  our strategy applicable even with the smallest number of libraries, but it
  also proves to be more powerful than previous strategies when more libraries
  are available. The methodology is equally applicable to other counting
  technologies, such as proteomic spectral counts.$\backslash$nAvailability: An

    KEGG (http://www.kegg.jp/ or http://www.genome.jp/ kegg/) is an integrated

    Read alignment is an ongoing challenge for the analysis of data from
  sequencing technologies. This article proposes an elegantly simple multi-seed
  strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping reads to a reference genome. The
  new strategy chooses the mapped genomic location for the read directly from
  the seeds. It uses a relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads)
  extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the optimal
  location. When the read length is {\textless}160 bp, overlapping subreads are
  used. More conventional alignment algorithms are then used to fill in
  detailed mismatch and indel information between the subreads that make up the
  winning voting block. The strategy is fast because the overall genomic
  location has already been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is
  sensitive because no individual subread is required to map exactly, nor are
  individual subreads constrained to map close by other subreads. It is
  accurate because the final location must be supported by several different
  subreads. The strategy extends easily to find exon junctions, by locating
  reads that contain sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same
  gene. It scales up efficiently for longer reads.%

    The sequencing of the full transcriptome (RNA-seq) has become the preferred
  choice for the measurement of genome-wide gene expression. Despite its
  widespread use, challenges remain in RNA-seq data analysis. One
  often-overlooked aspect is normalization. Despite the fact that a variety of
  factors or ‘batch effects' can contribute unwanted variation to the data,
  commonly used RNA-seq normalization methods only correct for sequencing
  depth. The study of gene expression is particularly problematic when it is
  influenced simultaneously by a variety of biological factors in addition to
  the one of interest. Using examples from experimental neuroscience, we show
  that batch effects can dominate the signal of interest; and that the choice
  of normalization method affects the power and reproducibility of the results.
  While commonly used global normalization methods are not able to adequately
  normalize the data, more recently developed RNA-seq normalization can. We
  focus on one particular method, RUVSeq and show that it is able to increase
  power and biological insight of the results. Finally, we provide a tutorial
  outlining the implementation of RUVSeq normalization that is applicable to a
  broad range of studies as well as meta-analysis of publicly available data.%

    BACKGROUND: Finding genes that are differentially expressed between
  conditions is an integral part of understanding the molecular basis of
  phenotypic variation. In the past decades, DNA microarrays have been used
  extensively to quantify the abundance of mRNA corresponding to different
  genes, and more recently high-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) has
  emerged as a powerful competitor. As the cost of sequencing decreases, it is
  conceivable that the use of RNA-seq for differential expression analysis will
  increase rapidly. To exploit the possibilities and address the challenges
  posed by this relatively new type of data, a number of software packages have
  been developed especially for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq
  data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We conducted an extensive comparison
  of eleven methods for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. All
  methods are freely available within the R framework and take as input a
  matrix of counts, i.e. the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature of
  interest in each of a number of samples. We evaluate the methods based on
  both simulated data and real RNA-seq
  data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Very small sample sizes, which
  are still common in RNA-seq experiments, impose problems for all evaluated
  methods and any results obtained under such conditions should be interpreted
  with caution. For larger sample sizes, the methods combining a
  variance-stabilizing transformation with the 'limma' method for differential
  expression analysis perform well under many different conditions, as does the
  nonparametric SAMseq method.%

    BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as the Illumina
  Genome Analyzer, are powerful new tools for investigating a wide range of
  biological and medical questions. Statistical and computational methods are
  key for drawing meaningful and accurate conclusions from the massive and
  complex datasets generated by the sequencers. We provide a detailed
  evaluation of statistical methods for normalization and differential
  expression (DE) analysis of Illumina transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq)
  data. RESULTS: We compare statistical methods for detecting genes that are
  significantly DE between two types of biological samples and find that there
  are substantial differences in how the test statistics handle low-count
  genes. We evaluate how DE results are affected by features of the sequencing
  platform, such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling calibration method
  (with and without phi X control lane), and flow-cell/library preparation
  effects. We investigate the impact of the read count normalization method on
  DE results and show that the standard approach of scaling by total lane
  counts (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We propose more general
  quantile-based normalization procedures and demonstrate an improvement in DE
  detection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results have significant practical and
  methodological implications for the design and analysis of mRNA-Seq
  experiments. They highlight the importance of appropriate statistical methods
  for normalization and DE inference, to account for features of the sequencing
  platform that could impact the accuracy of results. They also reveal the need
  for further research in the development of statistical and computational
  methods for mRNA-Seq.%

    STUDY DESIGN: Propensity score-matched, retrospective cohort study.
  OBJECTIVES: To determine the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in
  patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). SETTING: The present study used
  Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. METHODS: A total of
  9257 patients who had 2 ambulatory visits with a diagnosis of SCI in 2001
  were included in the SCI group. The non-SCI group consisted of 37,028
  propensity score-matched patients without a diagnosis of SCI. The cumulative
  incidence of AD was estimated for each of the two patient groups using the
  Kaplan-Meier method. Stratified Cox proportional hazard regression was then
  employed to assess the influence of SCI on the risk of AD. RESULTS: During
  the follow-up period, 25 subjects in the SCI group and 57 in the non-SCI
  group developed AD. The cumulative incidence of AD in the SCI group was
  higher than in the non-SCI group (P = 0.0168); and the hazard ratio of AD for
  the SCI group, as compared to the non-SCI group, was 1.71 (95{\%} CI
  1.06-2.76, P = 0.0273). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that patients with
  SCI have an increased risk of developing AD.%

    Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder
  that is associated with genetic risk factors. Most human disease-associated
  single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are not located in genes but rather
  are in regulatory regions that control gene expression. The function of
  regulatory regions is determined through epigenetic mechanisms. Parallels
  between the cellular basis of development and the formation of long-term
  memory have long been recognized, particularly the role of epigenetic
  mechanisms in both processes. We analyzed how learning alters chromatin
  accessibility in the mouse hippocampus using a new high-throughput sequencing
  bioinformatics strategy we call DEScan (differential enrichment scan).
  DEScan, which enabled the analysis of data from epigenomic experiments
  containing multiple replicates, revealed changes in chromatin accessibility
  at 2365 regulatory regions-most of which were promoters. Learning-regulated
  promoters were active during forebrain development in mice and were enriched
  in epigenetic modifications indicative of bivalent promoters. These promoters
  were disproportionally intronic, showed a complex relationship with gene
  expression and alternative splicing during memory consolidation and
  retrieval, and were enriched in the data set relative to known ASD risk
  genes. Genotyping in a clinical cohort within one of these promoters (SHANK3
  promoter 6) revealed that the SNP rs6010065 was associated with ASD. Our data
  support the idea that learning recapitulates development at the epigenetic
  level and demonstrate that behaviorally induced epigenetic changes in mice
  can highlight regulatory regions relevant to brain disorders in patients.%

    Disruptions in local chromatin structure often indicate features of
  biological interest such as regulatory regions. We find that sonication of
  cross-linked chromatin, when combined with a size-selection step and
  massively parallel short-read sequencing, can be used as a method (Sono-Seq)
  to map locations of high chromatin accessibility in promoter regions.
  Sono-Seq sites frequently correspond to actively transcribed promoter
  regions, as evidenced by their co-association with RNA Polymerase II ChIP
  regions, transcription start sites, histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation
  (H3K4me3) marks, and CpG islands; signals over other sites, such as those
  bound by the CTCF insulator, are also observed. The pattern of breakage by
  Sono-Seq overlaps with, but is distinct from, that observed for FAIRE and
  DNase I hypersensitive sites. Our results demonstrate that Sono-Seq can be a
  useful and simple method by which to map many local alterations in chromatin
  structure. Furthermore, our results provide insights into the mapping of
  binding sites by using ChIP–Seq experiments and the value of reference
  samples that should be used in such experiments.%

    SUMMARY: The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format is a generic alignment
  format for storing read alignments against reference sequences, supporting
  short and long reads (up to 128 Mbp) produced by different sequencing
  platforms. It is flexible in style, compact in size, efficient in random
  access and is the format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project
  are released. SAMtools implements various utilities for post-processing
  alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing, variant caller and alignment
  viewer, and thus provides universal tools for processing read alignments.

    We present Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq data, MACS, which analyzes data
  generated by short read sequencers such as Solexa's Genome Analyzer. MACS
  empirically models the shift size of ChIP-Seq tags, and uses it to improve
  the spatial resolution of predicted binding sites. MACS also uses a dynamic
  Poisson distribution to effectively capture local biases in the genome,
  allowing for more robust predictions. MACS compares favorably to existing
  ChIP-Seq peak-finding algorithms, and is freely available.%

    BACKGROUND Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput
  sequencing (ChIP-seq) or ChIP followed by genome tiling array analysis
  (ChIP-chip) have become standard technologies for genome-wide identification
  of DNA-binding protein target sites. A number of algorithms have been
  developed in parallel that allow identification of binding sites from
  ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip datasets and subsequent visualization in the University
  of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser as custom annotation tracks.
  However, summarizing these tracks can be a daunting task, particularly if
  there are a large number of binding sites or the binding sites are
  distributed widely across the genome. RESULTS We have developed ChIPpeakAnno
  as a Bioconductor package within the statistical programming environment R to
  facilitate batch annotation of enriched peaks identified from ChIP-seq,
  ChIP-chip, cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) or any experiments
  resulting in a large number of enriched genomic regions. The binding sites
  annotated with ChIPpeakAnno can be viewed easily as a table, a pie chart or
  plotted in histogram form, i.e., the distribution of distances to the nearest
  genes for each set of peaks. In addition, we have implemented functionalities
  for determining the significance of overlap between replicates or binding
  sites among transcription factors within a complex, and for drawing Venn
  diagrams to visualize the extent of the overlap between replicates.
  Furthermore, the package includes functionalities to retrieve sequences
  flanking putative binding sites for PCR amplification, cloning, or motif
  discovery, and to identify Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with adjacent
  genes. CONCLUSIONS ChIPpeakAnno enables batch annotation of the binding sites
  identified from ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip, CAGE or any technology that results in a
  large number of enriched genomic regions within the statistical programming
  environment R. Allowing users to pass their own annotation data such as a
  different Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) preparation and a dataset from
  literature, or existing annotation packages, such as GenomicFeatures and
  BSgenome, provides flexibility. Tight integration to the biomaRt package
  enables up-to-date annotation retrieval from the BioMart database.%

    The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) project was initiated in response to the
  growing demand for a public repository for high-throughput gene expression
  data. GEO provides a flexible and open design that facilitates submission,
  storage and retrieval of heterogeneous data sets from high-throughput gene
  expression and genomic hybridization experiments. GEO is not intended to
  replace in house gene expression databases that benefit from coherent data
  sets, and which are constructed to facilitate a particular analytic method,
  but rather complement these by acting as a tertiary, central data
  distribution hub. The three central data entities of GEO are platforms,
  samples and series, and were designed with gene expression and genomic
  hybridization experiments in mind. A platform is, essentially, a list of
  probes that define what set of molecules may be detected. A sample describes
  the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform
  used to generate its molecular abundance data. A series organizes samples
  into the meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. The GEO repository
  is publicly accessible through the World Wide Web at
  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo.%

    MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a
  challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript
  structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput
  of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer
  from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and
  mapping biases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To align our large
  ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we
  developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software
  based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses
  sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays
  followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other
  aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the
  human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest
  12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and
  precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions,
  STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts,
  and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454
  sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we
  experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an
  80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping
  strategy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is
  implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source software
  distributed under GPLv3 license and can be downloaded from
  http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/.%

    During the last 3 years, a number of approaches for the normalization of
  RNA sequencing data have emerged in the literature, differing both in the
  type of bias adjustment and in the statistical strategy adopted. However, as
  data continue to accumulate, there has been no clear consensus on the
  appropriate normalization method to be used or the impact of a chosen method
  on the downstream analysis. In this work, we focus on a comprehensive
  comparison of seven recently proposed normalization methods for the
  differential analysis of RNA-seq data, with an emphasis on the use of varied
  real and simulated datasets involving different species and experimental
  designs to represent data characteristics commonly observed in practice.
  Based on this comparison study, we propose practical recommendations on the
  appropriate normalization method to be used and its impact on the
  differential analysis of RNA-seq data.%

    A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read
  counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the ability to
  analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and
  blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation.
  Biological variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the
  technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical
  Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when
  there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such
  variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the
  Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates
  the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential
  expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression
  changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific
  variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed
  relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions
  de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to
  focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel
  computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting
  faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more
  convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted
  profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological
  variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical
  Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of
  assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods
  developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq
  applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation
  analyses.%

    The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the
  familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point
  out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing
  is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely
  rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent
  to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore,
  in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of
  the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple
  sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery
  rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the
  gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the
  appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.%

    Chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq)
  is widely used to identify binding sites for a target protein in the genome.
  An important scientific application is to identify changes in protein binding
  between different treatment conditions, i.e. to detect differential binding.
  This can reveal potential mechanisms through which changes in binding may
  contribute to the treatment effect. The csaw package provides a framework for
  the de novo detection of differentially bound genomic regions. It uses a
  window-based strategy to summarize read counts across the genome. It exploits
  existing statistical software to test for significant differences in each
  window. Finally, it clusters windows into regions for output and controls the
  false discovery rate properly over all detected regions. The csaw package can
  handle arbitrarily complex experimental designs involving biological
  replicates. It can be applied to both transcription factor and histone mark
  datasets, and, more generally, to any type of sequencing data measuring
  genomic coverage. csaw performs favorably against existing methods for de
  novo DB analyses on both simulated and real data. csaw is implemented as a R
  software package and is freely available from the open-source Bioconductor
  project.%

    Functional enrichment analysis is a key step in interpreting gene lists
  discovered in diverse high-throughput experiments. g:Profiler studies flat
  and ranked gene lists and finds statistically significant Gene Ontology
  terms, pathways and other gene function related terms. Translation of
  hundreds of gene identifiers is another core feature of g:Profiler. Since its
  first publication in 2007, our web server has become a popular tool of choice
  among basic and translational researchers. Timeliness is a major advantage of
  g:Profiler as genome and pathway information is synchronized with the Ensembl
  database in quarterly updates. g:Profiler supports 213 species including
  mammals and other vertebrates, plants, insects and fungi. The 2016 update of
  g:Profiler introduces several novel features. We have added further
  functional datasets to interpret gene lists, including transcription factor
  binding site predictions, Mendelian disease annotations, information about
  protein expression and complexes and gene mappings of human genetic
  polymorphisms. Besides the interactive web interface, g:Profiler can be
  accessed in computational pipelines using our R package, Python interface and
  BioJS component. g:Profiler is freely available at

    BACKGROUND: Gene set analysis is moving towards considering pathway
  topology as a crucial feature. Pathway elements are complex entities such as
  protein complexes, gene family members and chemical compounds. The conversion
  of pathway topology to a gene/protein networks (where nodes are a simple
  element like a gene/protein) is a critical and challenging task that enables
  topology-based gene set analyses.Unfortunately, currently available
  R/Bioconductor packages provide pathway networks only from single databases.
  They do not propagate signals through chemical compounds and do not
  differentiate between complexes and gene families.RESULTS: Here we present
  graphite, a Bioconductor package addressing these issues. Pathway information
  from four different databases is interpreted following specific
  biologically-driven rules that allow the reconstruction of gene-gene networks
  taking into account protein complexes, gene families and sensibly removing
  chemical compounds from the final graphs. The resulting networks represent a
  uniform resource for pathway analyses. Indeed, graphite provides easy access
  to three recently proposed topological methods. The graphite package is
  available as part of the Bioconductor software suite.CONCLUSIONS: graphite is
  an innovative package able to gather and make easily available the contents
  of the four major pathway databases. In the field of topological analysis
  graphite acts as a provider of biological information by reducing the pathway
  complexity considering the biological meaning of the pathway elements%

    High-throughput data production has revolutionized molecular biology.
  However, massive increases in data generation capacity require analysis
  approaches that are more sophisticated, and often very computationally
  intensive. Thus, making sense of high-throughput data requires informatics
  support. Galaxy (http://galaxyproject.org) is a software system that provides
  this support through a framework that gives experimentalists simple
  interfaces to powerful tools, while automatically managing the computational
  details. Galaxy is distributed both as a publicly available Web service,
  which provides tools for the analysis of genomic, comparative genomic, and
  functional genomic data, or a downloadable package that can be deployed in
  individual laboratories. Either way, it allows experimentalists without
  informatics or programming expertise to perform complex large-scale analysis
  with just a Web browser.%
