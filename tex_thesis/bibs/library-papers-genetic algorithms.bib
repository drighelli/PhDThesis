abstract = {Presents an application of genetic algorithms (GAs) to the gene network inference problem; this is one of the active topics in recent bioinformatics. The objective is to predict a regulating network structure of the interacting genes from the observed outcome, i.e. expression pattern. The task consists of modeling the rules of regulation and inferring the network structure from the observed data. The GA is applied to training the model with observed data in order to predict the regulatory pathways, represented as an influence matrix. We have implemented a reverse engineering method based on GAs in a quantitative and linear biological framework. The merit of this approach is that it can be applied with a small amount of data, it can optimize large numbers of parameters simultaneously and it can be applied to nonlinear models. The GA implementation includes multi-stage evolution and matrix chromosomes. This method has been applied to both simulated and experimentally observed gene expression patterns. In this research, we used the knowledge of designing an electric circuit by a GA},

@article{Goldberg1991b,
abstract = {This paper considers the effect of stochasticity on the quality of convergence of genetic algorithms (GAs). In many problems, the variance of building-block fitness or so-called collateral noise is the major source of variance, and a population-sizing equation is derived to ensure that average signal-to-collateral-noise ratios are favorable to the discrimination of the best building blocks required to solve a problem of bounded deception. The sizing relation is modified to permit the inclusion of other sources of stochasticity, such as the noise of selection, the noise of genetic operators, and the explicit noise or nondeterminism of the objective function. In a test suite of five functions, the sizing relation proves to be a conservative predictor of average correct convergence, as long as all major sources of noise are considered in the sizing calculation. These results suggest how the sizing equation may be viewed as a coarse delineation of a boundary between what a physicist might call two distinct phases of GA behavior. At low population sizes the GA makes many errors of decision, and the quality of convergence is largely left to the vagaries of chance or the serial fixup of flawed results through mutation or other serial injection of diversity. At large population sizes, GAs can reliably discriminate between good and bad building blocks, and parallel processing and recombination of building blocks lead to quick solution of even difficult deceptive problems. Additionally, the paper outlines a number of extensions to this work, including the development of more refined models of the relation between generational average error and ultimate convergence quality, the development of online methods for sizing populations via the estimation of population-s...},
