abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the corre- lation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth Interna- tional conference, ∗∗∗, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression. Keywords:},

@article{Boulesteix2012c,
abstract = {The random forest (RF) algorithm by Leo Breiman has become a standard data analysis tool in bioinformatics. It has shown excellent performance in settings where the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations, can cope with complex interaction structures as well as highly correlated variables and return measures of variable importance. This paper synthesizes 10 years of RF development with emphasis on applications to bioinformatics and computational biology. Special attention is paid to practical aspects such as the selection of parameters, available RF implementations, and important pitfalls and biases of RF and its variable importance measures (VIMs). The paper surveys recent developments of the methodology relevant to bioinformatics as well as some representative examples of RF applications in this context and possible directions for future research.},

@article{Qi2012c,
abstract = {Modern biology has experienced an increased use of machine learning techniques for large scale and complex biological data analysis. In the area of Bioinformatics, the Random Forest (RF) 6 technique, which includes an ensemble of decision trees and incorporates feature selection and interactions naturally in the learning process, is a popular choice. It is nonparametric, interpretable, efficient, and has high prediction accuracy for many types of data. Recent work in computational biology has seen an increased use of RF, owing to its unique advantages in dealing with small sample size, high-dimensional feature space, and complex data structures.},
