abstract = {The study of networks pervades all of science, from neurobiology to statistical physics. The most basic issues are structural: how does one characterize the wiring diagram of a food web or the Internet or the metabolic network of the bacterium topology? From the perspective of nonlinear dynamics, we would also like to understand how an enormous network of interacting dynamical systems — be they neurons, power stations or lasers — will behave collectively, given their individual dynamics and coupling architecture. Researchers are only now beginning Escherichia coli ? Are there any unifying principles underlying their to unravel the structure and dynamics of complex networks.},

@article{Guan2014,
abstract = {Interactions among transcriptional factors (TFs), cofactors and other proteins or enzymes can affect transcriptional regulatory capabilities of eukaryotic organisms. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) cooperate with TFs and epigenetic alterations to constitute a hierarchical complexity in transcriptional gene regulation. While clearly implicated in biological processes, our understanding of these complex regulatory mechanisms is still limited and incomplete. Various online software have been proposed for uncovering transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory networks, however, there is a lack of effective web-based software capable of constructing underlying interactive organizations between post-translational and transcriptional regulatory components. Here, we present an open web server, post-translational hierarchical gene regulatory network (PTHGRN) to unravel relationships among PTMs, TFs, epigenetic modifications and gene expression. PTHGRN utilizes a graphical Gaussian model with partial least squares regression-based methodology, and is able to integrate protein-protein interactions, ChIP-seq and gene expression data and to capture essential regulation features behind high-throughput data. The server provides an integrative platform for users to analyze ready-to-use public high-throughput Omics resources or upload their own data for systems biology study. Users can choose various parameters in the method, build network topologies of interests and dissect their associations with biological functions. Application of the software to stem cell and breast cancer demonstrates that it is an effective tool for understanding regulatory mechanisms in biological complex systems. PTHGRN web server is publically available at web site http://www.byanbioinfo.org/pthgrn.},

abstract = {In recent years views of eukaryotic gene expression have been transformed by the finding that enormous diversity can be generated at the RNA level. Advances in technologies for characterizing RNA populations are revealing increasingly complete descriptions of RNA regulation and complexity; for example, through alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation and RNA editing. New biochemical strategies to map protein-RNA interactions in vivo are yielding transcriptome-wide insights into mechanisms of RNA processing. These advances, combined with bioinformatics and genetic validation, are leading to the generation of functional RNA maps that reveal the rules underlying RNA regulation and networks of biologically coherent transcripts. Together these are providing new insights into molecular cell biology and disease.},

abstract = {: Network-based drug discovery aims at harnessing the power of networks to investigate the mechanism of action of existing drugs, or new molecules, in order to identify innovative therapeutic treatments. In this review, we describe some of the most recent advances in the field of network pharmacology, starting with approaches relying on computational models of transcriptional networks, then moving to protein and signaling network models and concluding with "drug networks". These networks are derived from different sources of experimental data, or literature-based analysis, and provide a complementary view of drug mode of action. Molecular and drug networks are powerful integrated computational and experimental approaches that will likely speed up and improve the drug discovery process, once fully integrated into the academic and industrial drug discovery pipeline.},

abstract = {Molecular networks represent the backbone of molecular activity within the cell. Recent studies have taken a comparative approach toward interpreting these networks, contrasting networks of different species and molecular types, and under varying conditions. In this review, we survey the field of comparative biological network analysis and describe its applications to elucidate cellular machinery and to predict protein function and interaction. We highlight the open problems in the field as well as propose some initial mathematical formulations for addressing them. Many of the methodological and conceptual advances that were important for sequence comparison will likely also be important at the network level, including improved search algorithms, techniques for multiple alignment, evolutionary models for similarity scoring and better integration with public databases.},

In this review, we present current and updated network inference methods focusing on novel techniques for data acquisition, network inference assessment, network inference for interacting species and the integration of prior knowledge. After the advance of Next-Generation-Sequencing of cDNAs derived from RNA samples (RNA-Seq) we discuss in detail its application to network inference. Furthermore, we present progress for large-scale or even full-genomic network inference as well as for small-scale condensed network inference and review advances in the evaluation of network inference methods by crowdsourcing. Finally, we reflect the current availability of data and prior knowledge sources and give an outlook for the inference of gene regulatory networks that reflect interacting species, in particular pathogen-host interactions.},

@article{Liao2003b,
abstract = {High-dimensional data sets generated by high-throughput technologies, such as DNA microarray, are often the outputs of complex networked systems driven by hidden regulatory signals. Traditional statistical methods for computing low-dimensional or hidden representations of these data sets, such as principal component analysis and independent component analysis, ignore the underlying network structures and provide decompositions based purely on a priori statistical constraints on the computed component signals. The resulting decomposition thus provides a phenomenological model for the observed data and does not necessarily contain physically or biologically meaningful signals. Here, we develop a method, called network component analysis, for uncovering hidden regulatory signals from outputs of networked systems, when only a partial knowledge of the underlying network topology is available. The a priori network structure information is first tested for compliance with a set of identifiability criteria. For networks that satisfy the criteria, the signals from the regulatory nodes and their strengths of influence on each output node can be faithfully reconstructed. This method is first validated experimentally by using the absorbance spectra of a network of various hemoglobin species. The method is then applied to microarray data generated from yeast Saccharamyces cerevisiae and the activities of various transcription factors during cell cycle are reconstructed by using recently discovered connectivity information for the underlying transcriptional regulatory networks.},
