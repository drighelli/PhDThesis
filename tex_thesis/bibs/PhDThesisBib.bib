abstract = {The advent of high throughput technologies has led to a wealth of publicly available biological data coming from different sources, the so-called 'omics data (transcriptomics for the study of transcripts, proteomics for proteins, metabolomics for metabolites, etc). Combining such large-scale biological data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a 'molecular signature') that explains or predicts biological conditions, but mainly for the analysis of a single data set. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. In contrast, linear multivariate methods adopt a system biology approach by statistically integrating several data sets at once and offer an unprecedented opportunity to probe relationships between heterogeneous data sets measured at multiple functional levels. mixOmics is an R package which provides a wide range of linear multivariate methods for data exploration, integration, dimension reduction and visualisation of biological data sets. The methods we have developed extend Projection to Latent Structure (PLS) models for discriminant analysis and data integration and include l1 penalisations to identify molecular signatures. Here we introduce the mixOmics methods specifically developed to integrate large data sets, either at the N-level, where the same individuals are profiled using different 'omics platforms (same N), or at the P-level, where independent studies including different individuals are generated under similar biological conditions using the same 'omics platform (same P). In both cases, the main challenge to face is data heterogeneity, due to inherent platform-specific artefacts (N-integration), or systematic differences arising from experiments assayed at different geographical sites or different times (P-integration). We present and illustrate those novel multivariate methods on existing 'omics data available from the package.},

@article{McCarthy2012,
abstract = {A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation analyses.},

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder that is associated with genetic risk factors. Most human disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are not located in genes but rather are in regulatory regions that control gene expression. The function of regulatory regions is determined through epigenetic mechanisms. Parallels between the cellular basis of development and the formation of long-term memory have long been recognized, particularly the role of epigenetic mechanisms in both processes. We analyzed how learning alters chromatin accessibility in the mouse hippocampus using a new high-throughput sequencing bioinformatics strategy we call DEScan (differential enrichment scan). DEScan, which enabled the analysis of data from epigenomic experiments containing multiple replicates, revealed changes in chromatin accessibility at 2365 regulatory regions-most of which were promoters. Learning-regulated promoters were active during forebrain development in mice and were enriched in epigenetic modifications indicative of bivalent promoters. These promoters were disproportionally intronic, showed a complex relationship with gene expression and alternative splicing during memory consolidation and retrieval, and were enriched in the data set relative to known ASD risk genes. Genotyping in a clinical cohort within one of these promoters (SHANK3 promoter 6) revealed that the SNP rs6010065 was associated with ASD. Our data support the idea that learning recapitulates development at the epigenetic level and demonstrate that behaviorally induced epigenetic changes in mice can highlight regulatory regions relevant to brain disorders in patients.},

The presence of noisy, low-expression genes can decrease the sensitivity of detecting DEGs. Thus, identification and filtering of these low-expression genes may improve DEG detection sensitivity. Using the SEQC benchmark dataset, we investigate the effect of different filtering methods on DEG detection sensitivity. Moreover, we investigate the effect of RNA-seq pipelines on optimal filtering thresholds. Results indicate that the filtering threshold that maximizes the total number of DEGs closely corresponds to the threshold that maximizes DEG detection sensitivity.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene set analysis is moving towards considering pathway topology as a crucial feature. Pathway elements are complex entities such as protein complexes, gene family members and chemical compounds. The conversion of pathway topology to a gene/protein networks (where nodes are a simple element like a gene/protein) is a critical and challenging task that enables topology-based gene set analyses.Unfortunately, currently available R/Bioconductor packages provide pathway networks only from single databases. They do not propagate signals through chemical compounds and do not differentiate between complexes and gene families.RESULTS: Here we present graphite, a Bioconductor package addressing these issues. Pathway information from four different databases is interpreted following specific biologically-driven rules that allow the reconstruction of gene-gene networks taking into account protein complexes, gene families and sensibly removing chemical compounds from the final graphs. The resulting networks represent a uniform resource for pathway analyses. Indeed, graphite provides easy access to three recently proposed topological methods. The graphite package is available as part of the Bioconductor software suite.CONCLUSIONS: graphite is an innovative package able to gather and make easily available the contents of the four major pathway databases. In the field of topological analysis graphite acts as a provider of biological information by reducing the pathway complexity considering the biological meaning of the pathway elements},

@article{Tarazona2012,
abstract = {http://bioinfo.cipf.es/aconesa     Introduction  Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have brought a revolution to research in genome and genome regulation. One of the most breaking applications of NGS is in transcriptome analysis. RNA-seq has revealed exciting new data on gene models, alternative splicing and extra-genic expression. Also RNA-seq permits the quantification of gene expression across a large dynamic range and with more reproducibility than microarrays. Several methods for the assessment of differential expression from count data have been proposed but biases associated to transcript length and transcript frequency distributions have been reported. It is still not clear how much sequencing reads should be generated in a RNA-seq experiment to obtain reliable results and what's exactly being detected. In general we observed that many RNA-seq datasets have not reached saturation for detection of expressed genes and that the relative proportion of different transcript biotypes changes with increasing sequencing depth. In this work we investigate the effect that library size has on the assessment of differential expression on different aspects of the selected genes. We show that current statistical methods suffer from a strong dependency of their significant calls on the number of mapped reads considered and proposed a novel differential expression methodology – NOISeq1- that is robust to the amount of reads.    Results  NOISeq is a non-parametric approach for the differential expression analysis of RNseq-data. NOISeq creates a null or noise distribution of count changes by comparing the number of reads of each gene in samples within the same condition. This reference distribution is then used to assess whether the change in count number between two conditions for a given gene is likely to be part of the noise or represents a true differential expression. Two variants of the method are implemented: NOISeq-real uses replicates, when available, to compute the noise distribution and, NOISeq-sim simulates them in absence of replication. We compared our method with edgeR2, DESeq3, baySeq4 and Fisher Exact Test (FET) using three different experimental datasets. Results are presented for MAQC experiment where the transcriptome of brain and Universal Human Reference (HUR) samples were sequenced at about 45 million Solexa reads each.   We first determined that although protein-coding gene is the most abundant transcript type within differential expression calls for all methodologies, other RNA types, such as processed-transcript, pseudogenes and lincRNAs are readily detected. NOISeq dected comparatively more protein-coding genes than other methods that called significant a considerable number of non-coding and small RNA transcripts. Additionally, all comparing methods except FET greatly increased the number of detected (non-coding) genes as sequencing depth raised while NOISeq showed a constant pattern. Also these other methods tend to select shorter genes and smaller fold change differences with the increasing amounts of reads. In general, parametric approaches selected much more genes than NOISeq, specially at high sequencing depth rates. When analyzing the functional content of these genes by functional enrichment analysis, we observed that the pool of genes detected both by NOISeq and the parametric methods where highly enriched in functional categories, while genes selected only by parametric methods did not. To check whether this differences were indicative of different false calls between methods, we used the RT-PCR data available at the MAQC project that contains 330 true positive and 83 true negative differentially expressed genes. Performance plots indicate that edgeR, DESeq, baySeq strongly increased the number of false calls with sequencing depth, while NOISeq was constant and low. On the contrary true discoveries were slightly better for these methods, presumably consequence of their large number of selected genes. FET showed in low false and true discovery rates, due to its general lower detection power.    Conclusions  We showed that most current RNA-seq statistical analysis methods fail to control the number of false discoveries as the size of the sequenced library increases. These false positive are mainly short, non- coding genes and/or genes with small fold changes. NOISeq, but adopting an empirical approach to model the null distribution of differential expression captures better the shape of noise in RNA-seq data, resulting in a sequencing-depth robust method for differential expression analysis.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) or ChIP followed by genome tiling array analysis (ChIP-chip) have become standard technologies for genome-wide identification of DNA-binding protein target sites. A number of algorithms have been developed in parallel that allow identification of binding sites from ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip datasets and subsequent visualization in the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser as custom annotation tracks. However, summarizing these tracks can be a daunting task, particularly if there are a large number of binding sites or the binding sites are distributed widely across the genome. RESULTS We have developed ChIPpeakAnno as a Bioconductor package within the statistical programming environment R to facilitate batch annotation of enriched peaks identified from ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip, cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) or any experiments resulting in a large number of enriched genomic regions. The binding sites annotated with ChIPpeakAnno can be viewed easily as a table, a pie chart or plotted in histogram form, i.e., the distribution of distances to the nearest genes for each set of peaks. In addition, we have implemented functionalities for determining the significance of overlap between replicates or binding sites among transcription factors within a complex, and for drawing Venn diagrams to visualize the extent of the overlap between replicates. Furthermore, the package includes functionalities to retrieve sequences flanking putative binding sites for PCR amplification, cloning, or motif discovery, and to identify Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with adjacent genes. CONCLUSIONS ChIPpeakAnno enables batch annotation of the binding sites identified from ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip, CAGE or any technology that results in a large number of enriched genomic regions within the statistical programming environment R. Allowing users to pass their own annotation data such as a different Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) preparation and a dataset from literature, or existing annotation packages, such as GenomicFeatures and BSgenome, provides flexibility. Tight integration to the biomaRt package enables up-to-date annotation retrieval from the BioMart database.},

abstract = {The correct identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between specific conditions is a key in the understanding phenotypic variation. High-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the main option for these studies. Thus, the number of methods and softwares for differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq data also increased rapidly. However, there is no consensus about the most appropriate pipeline or protocol for identifying differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq data. This work presents an extended review on the topic that includes the evaluation of six methods of mapping reads, including pseudo-alignment and quasi-mapping and nine methods of differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq data. The adopted methods were evaluated based on real RNA-Seq data, using qRT-PCR data as reference (gold-standard). As part of the results, we developed a software that performs all the analysis presented in this work, which is freely available at https://github.com/costasilvati/consexpression. The results indicated that mapping methods have minimal impact on the final DEGs analysis, considering that adopted data have an annotated reference genome. Regarding the adopted experimental model, the DEGs identification methods that have more consistent results were the limma+voom, NOIseq and DESeq2. Additionally, the consensus among five DEGs identification methods guarantees a list of DEGs with great accuracy, indicating that the combination of different methods can produce more suitable results. The consensus option is also included for use in the available software.},

abstract = {Read alignment is an ongoing challenge for the analysis of data from sequencing technologies. This article proposes an elegantly simple multi-seed strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping reads to a reference genome. The new strategy chooses the mapped genomic location for the read directly from the seeds. It uses a relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads) extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the optimal location. When the read length is {\textless}160 bp, overlapping subreads are used. More conventional alignment algorithms are then used to fill in detailed mismatch and indel information between the subreads that make up the winning voting block. The strategy is fast because the overall genomic location has already been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is sensitive because no individual subread is required to map exactly, nor are individual subreads constrained to map close by other subreads. It is accurate because the final location must be supported by several different subreads. The strategy extends easily to find exon junctions, by locating reads that contain sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same gene. It scales up efficiently for longer reads.},

Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) is widely used to identify binding sites for a target protein in the genome. An important scientific application is to identify changes in protein binding between different treatment conditions, i.e. to detect differential binding. This can reveal potential mechanisms through which changes in binding may contribute to the treatment effect. The csaw package provides a framework for the de novo detection of differentially bound genomic regions. It uses a window-based strategy to summarize read counts across the genome. It exploits existing statistical software to test for significant differences in each window. Finally, it clusters windows into regions for output and controls the false discovery rate properly over all detected regions. The csaw package can handle arbitrarily complex experimental designs involving biological replicates. It can be applied to both transcription factor and histone mark datasets, and, more generally, to any type of sequencing data measuring genomic coverage. csaw performs favorably against existing methods for de novo DB analyses on both simulated and real data. csaw is implemented as a R software package and is freely available from the open-source Bioconductor project.},

We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the possibility of using them directly for normalization. We show that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods. In particular, RUV promises to be valuable for large collaborative projects involving multiple laboratories, technicians, and/or sequencing platforms.},

We find that sonication of cross-linked chromatin, when combined with a size-selection step and massively parallel short-read sequencing, can be used as a method (Sono-Seq) to map locations of high chromatin accessibility in promoter regions. Sono-Seq sites frequently correspond to actively transcribed promoter regions, as evidenced by their co-association with RNA Polymerase II ChIP regions, transcription start sites, histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks, and CpG islands; signals over other sites, such as those bound by the CTCF insulator, are also observed. The pattern of breakage by Sono-Seq overlaps with, but is distinct from, that observed for FAIRE and DNase I hypersensitive sites. Our results demonstrate that Sono-Seq can be a useful and simple method by which to map many local alterations in chromatin structure. Furthermore, our results provide insights into the mapping of binding sites by using ChIP–Seq experiments and the value of reference samples that should be used in such experiments.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.
