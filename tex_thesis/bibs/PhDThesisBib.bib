abstract = {The Bioconductor project is an initiative for the collaborative creation of extensible software for computational biology and bioinformatics. The goals of the project include: fostering collaborative development and widespread use of innovative software, reducing barriers to entry into interdisciplinary scientific research, and promoting the achievement of remote reproducibility of research results. We describe details of our aims and methods, identify current challenges, compare Bioconductor to other open bioinformatics projects, and provide working examples.},

@article{Wang2009d,
abstract = {RNA-Seq is a recently developed approach to transcriptome profiling that uses deep-sequencing technologies. Studies using this method have already altered our view of the extent and complexity of eukaryotic transcriptomes. RNA-Seq also provides a far more precise measurement of levels of transcripts and their isoforms than other methods. This article describes the RNA-Seq approach, the challenges associated with its application, and the advances made so far in characterizing several eukaryote transcriptomes.},

@article{Ihaka1996,
abstract = {In this article we discuss our experience designing and implementing a statistical computing language. In developing this new language, we sought to combine what we felt were useful features from two existing computer languages. We feel that the new lan- guage provides advantages in the areas of portability, computational efficiency, memory management, and scoping.},
