abstract = {SEMAT (Software Engineering Method and Theory) and its many supporters agree that software engineering is gravely hampered by immature practices. For this reason, SEMAT supports a process to re-found software engineering based on a solid theory, proven principles and best practices that includes a kernel of widelyagreed elements that is extensible for specific uses and addresses both technology and people issues. SEMAT focuses on changing the way people deal with methods and processes, which in turn, will impact our industry, education, research and developer community. In this paper we provide a snapshot of some of SEMAT's results and report on the experiences gained both within the academia and industry.},

@article{Fomel2009b,
abstract = {The articles in this special issue provide independent solutions for practical reproducible research systems. The use of Matlab-based tools such as the famous Wavelab and Sparselab packages in promoting reproducible research in computational harmonic analysis has been presented. In particular, the authors point to the success of the reproducible research discipline in increasing the reliability of computational research and reflect on the effort necessary for implementing this discipline in a research group and overcoming possible objections to it. An article also describes a Python interface to the well-known Clawpack package for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations that appear in wave propagation problems. The author argues strongly in favor of reproducible computations and shows an example using a simplified Python interface to Fortran code. An article also represents the field of bioinformatics, which has been a stronghold of reproducible research. It describes the cacher package, which is built on top of the R computing environment. Cacher enables a modular approach to reproducible computations by storing results of intermediate computations in a database. The special issue ends with an article on the legal aspects of reproducible research, including copyright and licensing issues.},

abstract = {Scientific computation is emerging as absolutely central to the scientific method. Unfortunately, it's error-prone and currently immature—traditional scientific publication is incapable of finding and rooting out errors in scientific computation—which must be recognized as a crisis. An important recent development and a necessary response to the crisis is reproducible computational research in which researchers publish the article along with the full computational environment that produces the results. The authors have practiced reproducible computational research for 15 years and have integrated it with their scientific research and with doctoral and postdoctoral education. In this article, they review their approach and how it has evolved over time, discussing the arguments for and against working reproducibly.},

abstract = {We present the cacher package for R, which provides tools for caching statistical analyses and for distributing these analyses to others in an efficient manner. The cacher package takes objects created by evaluating R expressions and stores them in key-value databases. These databases of cached objects can subsequently be assembled into packages for distribution over the web. The cacher package also provides tools to help readers examine the data and code in a statistical analysis and reproduce, modify, or improve upon the results. In addition, readers can easily conduct alternate analyses of the data. We describe the design and implementation of the cacher package and provide two examples of how the package can be used for reproducible research.},

The library is available free of charge over the Internet. Versions are provided for Macintosh, UNIX and Windows machines. WAVELAB makes available, in onc package, all the code to reproduce all the figures in our published wavelet articles. The interested reader can inspect the source code to see exactly what algorithms were used, how parameters were set in producing our figures, and can then modify the source to produce variations on our results. WAVELAB has been developed, in part, because of exhortations by Jon Claerbout of Stanford that computational scientists should engage in "really reproducible" research. 1},

@article{Liu2014d,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is scientifically and ethically imperative that the results of statistical analysis of biomedical research data be computationally reproducible in the sense that the reported results can be easily recapitulated from the study data. Some statistical analyses are computationally a function of many data files, program files, and other details that are updated or corrected over time. In many applications, it is infeasible to manually maintain an accurate and complete record of all these details about a particular analysis. RESULTS: Therefore, we developed the rctrack package that automatically collects and archives read only copies of program files, data files, and other details needed to computationally reproduce an analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The rctrack package uses the trace function to temporarily embed detail collection procedures into functions that read files, write files, or generate random numbers so that no special modifications of the primary R program are necessary. At the conclusion of the analysis, rctrack uses these details to automatically generate a read only archive of data files, program files, result files, and other details needed to recapitulate the analysis results. Information about this archive may be included as an appendix of a report generated by Sweave or knitR. Here, we describe the usage, implementation, and other features of the rctrack package. The rctrack package is freely available from http://www.stjuderesearch.org/site/depts/biostats/rctrack under the GPL license.},
