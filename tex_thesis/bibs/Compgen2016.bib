abstract = {Interpreting gene expression profiles often involves statistical analysis of large numbers of differentially expressed genes, isoforms, and alternative splicing events at either static or dynamic spectrums. Reduced sequencing costs have made feasible dense time-series analysis of gene expression using RNA-seq; however, statistical methods in the context of temporal RNA-seq data are poorly developed. Here we will review current methods for identifying temporal changes in gene expression using RNA-seq, which are limited to static pairwise comparisons of time points and which fail to account for temporal dependencies in gene expression patterns. We also review recently developed very few number of temporal dynamic RNA-seq specific methods. Application and development of RNA-specific temporal dynamic methods have been continuously under the development, yet, it is still in infancy. We fully cover microarray specific temporal methods and transcriptome studies in initial digital technology (e.g., SAGE) between traditional microarray and new RNA-seq.},

@article{Spies2015a,
abstract = {Analysis of gene expression has contributed to a plethora of biological and medical research studies. Microarrays have been intensively used for the profiling of gene expression during diverse developmental processes, treatments and diseases. New massively parallel sequencing methods, often named as RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) are extensively improving our understanding of gene regulation and signaling networks. Computational methods developed originally for microarrays analysis can now be optimized and applied to genome-wide studies in order to have access to a better comprehension of the whole transcriptome. This review addresses current challenges on RNA-seq analysis and specifically focuses on new bioinformatics tools developed for time series experiments. Furthermore, possible improvements in analysis, data integration as well as future applications of differential expression analysis are discussed.},

@article{Ritchie2015i,
abstract = {Recent technological advances have expanded the breadth of available omic data, from whole-genome sequencing data, to extensive transcriptomic, methylomic and metabolomic data. A key goal of analyses of these data is the identification of effective models that predict phenotypic traits and outcomes, elucidating important biomarkers and generating important insights into the genetic underpinnings of the heritability of complex traits. There is still a need for powerful and advanced analysis strategies to fully harness the utility of these comprehensive high-throughput data, identifying true associations and reducing the number of false associations. In this Review, we explore the emerging approaches for data integration [mdash] including meta-dimensional and multi-staged analyses [mdash] which aim to deepen our understanding of the role of genetics and genomics in complex outcomes. With the use and further development of these approaches, an improved understanding of the relationship between genomic variation and human phenotypes may be revealed.},

@article{Rohart2016a,
abstract = {The solution to identify a reliable molecular signature in transcriptomics high-throughput experiments is to increase sample size by combining independent but related studies. However, those data sets are generated using different protocols and technological platforms, which results in unwanted systematic variation that strongly confounds the integrative analysis results. We introduce a Multivariate INTegrative method, MINT, that identifies a highly reproducible, accurate and predictive gene signature to classify sample phenotypes while accounting for platform and study variation. MINT led to superior and unbiased classification performance compared to other existing methods, and identified highly relevant gene signatures when integrating two multi-transcriptomics studies.},

@article{Mele2015,
abstract = {Transcriptional regulation and posttranscriptional processing underlie many cellular and organismal phenotypes. We used RNA sequence data generated by Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to investigate the patterns of transcriptome variation across individuals and tissues. Tissues exhibit characteristic transcriptional signatures that show stability in postmortem samples. These signatures are dominated by a relatively small number of genes--which is most clearly seen in blood--though few are exclusive to a particular tissue and vary more across tissues than individuals. Genes exhibiting high interindividual expression variation include disease candidates associated with sex, ethnicity, and age. Primary transcription is the major driver of cellular specificity, with splicing playing mostly a complementary role; except for the brain, which exhibits a more divergent splicing program. Variation in splicing, despite its stochasticity, may play in contrast a comparatively greater role in defining individual phenotypes.},

@article{Civelek2014a,
abstract = {Systems genetics is an approach to understand the flow of biological information that underlies complex traits. It uses a range of experimental and statistical methods to quantitate and integrate intermediate phenotypes, such as transcript, protein or metabolite levels, in populations that vary for traits of interest. Systems genetics studies have provided the first global view of the molecular architecture of complex traits and are useful for the identification of genes, pathways and networks that underlie common human diseases. Given the urgent need to understand how the thousands of loci that have been identified in genome-wide association studies contribute to disease susceptibility, systems genetics is likely to become an increasingly important approach to understanding both biology and disease.},
