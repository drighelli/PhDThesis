abstract = {Genome scale data on biological systems has increasingly become available by sequencing of DNA and RNA, and by mass spectrometric quantification of proteins and metabolites. The cellular components from which these -omics regimes are derived act as one integrated system in vivo; thus, there is a natural instinct to integrate -omics data types. Statistical analyses, the use of previous knowledge in the form of networks, and the use of time-resolved measurements are three key design elements for life scientists to consider in planning integrated -omics studies. These design elements are reviewed in the context of multiple recent systems biology studies that leverage data from different types of -omics analyses. While most of these studies rely on well-established model organisms, the concepts for integrating -omics data that were developed in these studies can help to enable systems research in the field of cancer biology.},

abstract = {The term " epigenetics, " first coined in 1942, refers to heritable traits of cells (over many rounds of cell division) that do not involve changes to the under-lying DNA sequence. The 2 predominant epigenetic mechanisms are DNA methylation and histone modification. Epigenetic changes, especially methylation of DNA at the 5 position of cytosine, which occurs in cytosine/ guanine-rich regions (CpG islands), may have major effects on gene transcription. For example, it is known that extensive methylation at GC-rich regions of gene promoters or other areas can dramatically affect gene transcription and consequently the whole biology of a particular cell. Epigenetic changes are preserved when cells divide. Although it is well-known that cancer may be caused by the loss of tumor suppressor genes (e.g., through mutation or deletion), another major mecha-nism of silencing critical genes is through methylation. There are numerous examples of genes that can be si-lenced by methylation. It is thus reasonable to suggest that DNA methylation may be a marker of gene silenc-ing and that such modifications may correlate with cancer initiation and progression. For this reason, it is likely that epigenetic changes in DNA may carry diag-nostic, prognostic, or predictive information. It is thus not surprising that epigenomic/epigenetic changes have attracted increased attention recently for their possible application in cancer and other disease diag-nostics. In this Q{\&}A, 4 experts in the field discuss the present and future of epigenomics as they apply to di-agnostic applications.},

With recent advances in transcriptomics and next-generation sequencing, co-expression networks constructed from RNA sequencing data also enable the inference of functions and disease associations for non-coding genes and splice variants. Although gene co-expression networks typically do not provide information about causality, emerging methods for differential co-expression analysis are enabling the identification of regulatory genes underlying various phenotypes. Here, we introduce and guide researchers through a (differential) co-expression analysis. We provide an overview of methods and tools used to create and analyse co-expression networks constructed from gene expression data, and we explain how these can be used to identify genes with a regulatory role in disease. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of other data types with co-expression networks and offer future perspectives of co-expression analysis.},

abstract = {Understanding the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes is essential to disentangle biological mechanisms and to unravel the molecular basis of diseases. Genes and proteins are closely linked in biological systems. However, genomics and proteomics have developed separately into two distinct disciplines whereby crosstalk among scientists from the two domains has been limited and this constrains the integration of both fields into a single data modality of useful information. The emerging field of proteogenomics attempts to address this by building bridges between the two disciplines. In this review, we briefly discuss how genomics and transcriptomics data in different formats can be utilized to assist proteogenomics application. Subsequently, a much larger part of this review focuses on proteogenomics research that are published in the last five years that answer two important questions. Firstly, we discuss how proteogenomics can be applied to tackle biological problems, covering genome annotation and precision medicine. Secondly, we cover the latest developments in analytical technologies for data acquisition and the bioinformatics tools to interpret and visualize proteogenomics data.

abstract = {Advances in the technologies and informatics used to generate and process large biological data sets (omics data) are promoting a critical shift in the study of biomedical sciences. While genomics, transcriptomics and proteinomics, coupled with bioinformatics and biostatistics, are gaining momentum, they are still, for the most part, assessed individually with distinct approaches generating monothematic rather than integrated knowledge. As other areas of biomedical sciences, including metabolomics, epigenomics and pharmacogenomics, are moving towards the omics scale, we are witnessing the rise of inter-disciplinary data integration strategies to support a better understanding of biological systems and eventually the development of successful precision medicine. This review cuts across the boundaries between genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics, summarizing how omics data are generated, analysed and shared, and provides an overview of the current strengths and weaknesses of this global approach. This work intends to target students and researchers seeking knowledge outside of their field of expertise and fosters a leap from the reductionist to the global-integrative analytical approach in research.},

abstract = {Bacterial phenotypic traits and lifestyles in response to diverse environmental conditions depend on changes in the internal molecular environment. However, predicting bacterial adaptability is still difficult outside of laboratory controlled conditions. Many molecular levels can contribute to the adaptation to a changing environment: pathway structure, codon usage, metabolism. To measure adaptability to changing environmental conditions and over time, we develop a multi-omic model of Escherichia coli that accounts for metabolism, gene expression and codon usage at both transcription and translation levels. After the integration of multiple omics into the model, we propose a multiobjective optimization algorithm to find the allowable and optimal metabolic phenotypes through concurrent maximization or minimization of multiple metabolic markers. In the condition space, we propose Pareto hypervolume and spectral analysis as estimators of short term multi-omic (transcriptomic and metabolic) evolution, thus enabling comparative analysis of metabolic conditions. We therefore compare, evaluate and cluster different experimental conditions, models and bacterial strains according to their metabolic response in a multidimensional objective space, rather than in the original space of microarray data. We finally validate our methods on a phenomics dataset of growth conditions. Our framework, named METRADE, is freely available as a MATLAB toolbox.},
