@article{Cheng2000c,
abstract = {An efficient node-deletion algorithm is introduced to find submatrices in expression data that have low mean squared residue scores and it is shown to perform well in finding co-regulation patterns in yeast and human. This introduces "biclustering", or simultaneous clustering of both genes and conditions, to knowledge discovery from expression data. This approach overcomes some problems associated with traditional clustering methods, by allowing automatic discovery of similarity based on a subset of attributes, simultaneous clustering of genes and conditions, and overlapped grouping that provides a better representation for genes with multiple functions or regulated by many factors.},

@article{Yan2013c,
abstract = {Biclustering is an important tool to find patterns in a microarray data matrix by simultaneous classification in two dimensions of genes and conditions. Unlike most existed biclustering algorithms where almost all genes and conditions are involved in the clustering process even if they contribute little to a bicluster, we propose to perform the biclustering operation only in related genes and conditions of a given bicluster type. In our algorithm, the gene expression matrix is first partitioned to stable and unstable submatrices in both row and column directions by inspecting the similarity between the row (or column) vector and the full 1s vector, then the related genes and conditions of a given type of biclusters are extracted by inspecting the row or column pairs in the corresponding stable or unstable submatrices, finally the resulted biclusters of any type are obtained by performing clustering analysis in the extracted related genes and conditions. Additionally, a novel strategy for estimating the missing data in the gene expression matrix is also presented based on the James-Stein and kernel estimation principle where the estimation matrix is obtained with the k means algorithm. Experimental results show excellent performance of our algorithm both in missing data estimation and biclustering. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Flores2013c,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the emerging techniques for performing the analysis of the DNA microarray data known as biclustering is the search of subsets of genes and conditions which are coherently expressed. These subgroups provide clues about the main biological processes. Until now, different approaches to this problem have been proposed. Most of them use the mean squared residue as quality measure but relevant and interesting patterns can not be detected such as shifting, or scaling patterns. Furthermore, recent papers show that there exist new coherence patterns involved in different kinds of cancer and tumors such as inverse relationships between genes which can not be captured.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The proposed measure is called Spearman's biclustering measure (SBM) which performs an estimation of the quality of a bicluster based on the non-linear correlation among genes and conditions simultaneously. The search of biclusters is performed by using a evolutionary technique called estimation of distribution algorithms which uses the SBM measure as fitness function. This approach has been examined from different points of view by using artificial and real microarrays. The assessment process has involved the use of quality indexes, a set of bicluster patterns of reference including new patterns and a set of statistical tests. It has been also examined the performance using real microarrays and comparing to different algorithmic approaches such as Bimax, CC, OPSM, Plaid and xMotifs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: SBM shows several advantages such as the ability to recognize more complex coherence patterns such as shifting, scaling and inversion and the capability to selectively marginalize genes and conditions depending on the statistical significance.},

@article{Divina2012c,
abstract = {Biclustering is becoming a popular technique for the study of gene expression data. This is mainly due to the capability of biclustering to address the data using various dimensions simultaneously, as opposed to clustering, which can use only one dimension at the time. Different heuristics have been proposed in order to discover interesting biclusters in data. Such heuristics have one common characteristic: they are guided by a measure that determines the quality of biclusters. It follows that defining such a measure is probably the most important aspect. One of the popular quality measure is the mean squared residue (MSR). However, it has been proven that MSR fails at identifying some kind of patterns. This motivates us to introduce a novel measure, called virtual error (VE), that overcomes this limitation. Results obtained by using VE confirm that it can identify interesting patterns that could not be found by MSR.},

@article{Zhao2012c,
abstract = {Biclustering analysis is a useful methodology to discover the local coherent patterns hidden in a data matrix. Unlike the traditional clustering procedure, which searches for groups of coherent patterns using the entire feature set, biclustering performs simultaneous pattern classification in both row and column directions in a data matrix. The technique has found useful applications in many fields but notably in bioinformatics. In this paper, we give an overview of the biclustering problem and review some existing biclustering algorithms in terms of their underlying methodology, search strategy, detected bicluster patterns, and validation strategies. Moreover, we show that geometry of biclustering patterns can be used to solve biclustering problems effectively. Well-known methods in signal and image analysis, such as the Hough transform and relaxation labeling, can be employed to detect the geometrical biclustering patterns. We present performance evaluation results for several of the well known biclustering algorithms, on both artificial and real gene expression datasets. Finally, several interesting applications of biclustering are discussed.},
