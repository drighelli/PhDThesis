abstract = {We explain the problem of selective inference in complex research using a recently published study: a replicability study of the associations in order to reveal and establish risk loci for type 2 diabetes. The false discovery rate approach to such problems will be reviewed, and we further address two problems: (i) setting confidence intervals on the size of the risk at the selected locations and (ii) selecting the replicable results.},

@article{Kang2009b,
abstract = {Multiple hypothesis testing is commonly used in genome research such as genome-wide studies and gene expression data analysis (Lin, 2005). The widely used Bonferroni procedure controls the family-wise error rate (FWER) for multiple hypothesis testing, but has limited statistical power as the number of hypotheses tested increases. The power of multiple testing procedures can be increased by using weighted p-values (Genovese et al., 2006). The weights for the p-values can be estimated by using certain prior information. Wasserman and Roeder (2006) described a weighted Bonferroni procedure, which incorporates weighted p-values into the Bonferroni procedure, and Rubin et al. (2006) and Wasserman and Roeder (2006) estimated the optimal weights that maximize the power of the weighted Bonferroni procedure under the assumption that the means of the test statistics in the multiple testing are known (these weights are called optimal Bonferroni weights). This weighted Bonferroni procedure controls FWER and can have higher power than the Bonferroni procedure, especially when the optimal Bonferroni weights are used. To further improve the power of the weighted Bonferroni procedure, first we propose a weighted Sid{\'{a}}k procedure that incorporates weighted p-values into the Sid{\'{a}}k procedure, and then we estimate the optimal weights that maximize the average power of the weighted Sid{\'{a}}k procedure under the assumption that the means of the test statistics in the multiple testing are known (these weights are called optimal Sid{\'{a}}k weights). This weighted Sid{\'{a}}k procedure can have higher power than the weighted Bonferroni procedure. Second, we develop a generalized sequential (GS) Sid{\'{a}}k procedure that incorporates weighted p-values into the sequential Sid{\'{a}}k procedure (Scherrer, 1984). This GS id{\'{a}}k procedure is an extension of and has higher power than the GS Bonferroni procedure of Holm (1979). Finally, under the assumption that the means of the test statistics in the multiple testing are known, we incorporate the optimal Sid{\'{a}}k weights and the optimal Bonferroni weights into the GS Sid{\'{a}}k procedure and the GS Bonferroni procedure, respectively. Theoretical proof and/or simulation studies show that the GS Sid{\'{a}}k procedure can have higher power than the GS Bonferroni procedure when their corresponding optimal weights are used, and that both of these GS procedures can have much higher power than the weighted Sid{\'{a}}k and the weighted Bonferroni procedures. All proposed procedures control the FWER well and are useful when prior information is available to estimate the weights.},

@article{Benjamini2014e,
abstract = {In many complex multiple-testing problems the hypotheses are divided into families. Given the data, families with evidence for true discoveries are selected, and hypotheses within them are tested. Neither controlling the error rate in each family separately nor controlling the error rate over all hypotheses together can assure some level of confidence about the filtration of errors within the selected families. We formulate this concern about selective inference in its generality, for a very wide class of error rates and for any selection criterion, and present an adjustment of the testing level inside the selected families that retains control of the expected average error over the selected families. {\textcopyright} 2013 Royal Statistical Society.},
