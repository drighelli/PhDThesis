abstract = {Recent technological advances have expanded the breadth of available omic data, from whole-genome sequencing data, to extensive transcriptomic, methylomic and metabolomic data. A key goal of analyses of these data is the identification of effective models that predict phenotypic traits and outcomes, elucidating important biomarkers and generating important insights into the genetic underpinnings of the heritability of complex traits. There is still a need for powerful and advanced analysis strategies to fully harness the utility of these comprehensive high-throughput data, identifying true associations and reducing the number of false associations. In this Review, we explore the emerging approaches for data integration [mdash] including meta-dimensional and multi-staged analyses [mdash] which aim to deepen our understanding of the role of genetics and genomics in complex outcomes. With the use and further development of these approaches, an improved understanding of the relationship between genomic variation and human phenotypes may be revealed.},

abstract = {The epigenetic regulation of gene expression involves multiple factors. The synergistic or antagonistic action of these factors has suggested the existence of an epigenetic code for gene regulation. Highthroughput sequencing (HTS) provides an opportunity to explore this code and to build quantitative models of gene regulation based on epigenetic differences between specific cellular conditions. We describe a new computational framework that facilitates the systematic integration of HTS epigenetic data. Our method relates epigenetic signals to expression by comparing two conditions. We show its effectiveness by building a model that predicts with high accuracy significant expression differences between two cell lines, using epigenetic data from the ENCODE project. Our analyses provide evidence for a degenerate epigenetic code, which involves multiple genic regions. In particular, signal changes at the 1st exon, 1st intron, and downstream of the polyadenylation site are found to associate strongly with expression regulation. Our analyses also show a different epigenetic code for intron-less and intron-containing genes. Our work provides a general methodology to do integrative analysis of epigenetic differences between cellular conditions that can be applied to other studies, like cell differentiation or carcinogenesis.},

abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) has great potential for elucidating transcriptional networks, by measuring genome-wide binding of transcription factors (TFs) at high resolution. Despite the precision of these experiments, identification of genes directly regulated by a TF (target genes) is not trivial. Numerous target gene scoring methods have been used in the past. However, their suitability for the task and their performance remain unclear, because a thorough comparative assessment of these methods is still lacking. Here we present a systematic evaluation of computational methods for defining TF targets based on ChIP-seq data. We validated predictions based on 68 ChIP-seq studies using a wide range of genomic expression data and functional information. We demonstrate that peak-to-gene assignment is the most crucial step for correct target gene prediction and propose a parameter-free method performing most consistently across the evaluation tests.},

@article{Meng2014c,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: To leverage the potential of multi-omics studies, exploratory data analysis methods that provide systematic integration and comparison of multiple layers of omics information are required. We describe multiple co-inertia analysis (MCIA), an exploratory data analysis method that identifies co-relationships between multiple high dimensional datasets. Based on a covariance optimization criterion, MCIA simultaneously projects several datasets into the same dimensional space, transforming diverse sets of features onto the same scale, to extract the most variant from each dataset and facilitate biological interpretation and pathway analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We demonstrate integration of multiple layers of information using MCIA, applied to two typical "omics" research scenarios. The integration of transcriptome and proteome profiles of cells in the NCI-60 cancer cell line panel revealed distinct, complementary features, which together increased the coverage and power of pathway analysis. Our analysis highlighted the importance of the leukemia extravasation signaling pathway in leukemia that was not highly ranked in the analysis of any individual dataset. Secondly, we compared transcriptome profiles of high grade serous ovarian tumors that were obtained, on two different microarray platforms and next generation RNA-sequencing, to identify the most informative platform and extract robust biomarkers of molecular subtypes. We discovered that the variance of RNA-sequencing data processed using RPKM had greater variance than that with MapSplice and RSEM. We provided novel markers highly associated to tumor molecular subtype combined from four data platforms. MCIA is implemented and available in the R/Bioconductor "omicade4" package.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We believe MCIA is an attractive method for data integration and visualization of several datasets of multi-omics features observed on the same set of individuals. The method is not dependent on feature annotation, and thus it can extract important features even when there are not present across all datasets. MCIA provides simple graphical representations for the identification of relationships between large datasets.},

abstract = {The advent of high throughput technologies has led to a wealth of publicly available ‘omics data coming from different sources, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics. Combining such large-scale biological data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a ‘molecular signature') to explain or predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of ‘omics. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. We introduce mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous ‘omics data sets. Our recent methods extend Projection to Latent Structure (PLS) models for discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple ‘omics data or across independent studies, and for the identification of molecular signatures. We illustrate our latest mixOmics integrative frameworks for the multivariate analyses of ‘omics data available from the package.},

We present Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA), an unsupervised dimensionality reduction method for discovering the driving sources of variation in multi-omics data. Our model infers a set of (hidden) factors that capture biological and technical sources of variability across data modalities. We applied MOFA to data from 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) profiled for somatic mutations, RNA expression, DNA methylation and ex-vivo responses to a panel of drugs. MOFA automatically discovered the known dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) status and trisomy of chromosome 12, as well as previously underappreciated drivers of variation, such as response to oxidative stress. These factors capture key dimensions of patient heterogeneity, including those linked to clinical outcomes. Finally, MOFA handles missing data modalities in subsets of samples, enabling imputation, and the model can identify outlier samples.},

abstract = {Histones are frequently decorated with covalent modifications. These histone modifications are thought to be involved in various chromatin-dependent processes including transcription. To elucidate the relationship between histone modifications and transcription, we derived quantitative models to predict the expression level of genes from histone modification levels. We found that histone modification levels and gene expression are very well correlated. Moreover, we show that only a small number of histone modifications are necessary to accurately predict gene expression. We show that different sets of histone modifications are necessary to predict gene expression driven by high CpG content promoters (HCPs) or low CpG content promoters (LCPs). Quantitative models involving H3K4me3 and H3K79me1 are the most predictive of the expression levels in LCPs, whereas HCPs require H3K27ac and H4K20me1. Finally, we show that the connections between histone modifications and gene expression seem to be general, as we were able to predict gene expression levels of one cell type using a model trained on another one.},

abstract = {Recent technological advances have expanded the breadth of available omic data, from whole-genome sequencing data, to extensive transcriptomic, methylomic and metabolomic data. A key goal of analyses of these data is the identification of effective models that predict phenotypic traits and outcomes, elucidating important biomarkers and generating important insights into the genetic underpinnings of the heritability of complex traits. There is still a need for powerful and advanced analysis strategies to fully harness the utility of these comprehensive high-throughput data, identifying true associations and reducing the number of false associations. In this Review, we explore the emerging approaches for data integration [mdash] including meta-dimensional and multi-staged analyses [mdash] which aim to deepen our understanding of the role of genetics and genomics in complex outcomes. With the use and further development of these approaches, an improved understanding of the relationship between genomic variation and human phenotypes may be revealed.},

@article{McLeay2012c,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Modelling the regulation of gene expression can provide insight into the regulatory roles of individual transcription factors (TFs) and histone modifications. Recently, Ouyang et al. in 2009 modelled gene expression levels in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells using in vivo ChIP-seq measurements of TF binding. ChIP-seq TF binding data, however, are tissue-specific and relatively difficult to obtain. This limits the applicability of gene expression models that rely on ChIP-seq TF binding data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In this study, we build regression-based models that relate gene expression to the binding of 12 different TFs, 7 histone modifications and chromatin accessibility (DNase I hypersensitivity) in two different tissues. We find that expression models based on computationally predicted TF binding can achieve similar accuracy to those using in vivo TF binding data and that including binding at weak sites is critical for accurate prediction of gene expression. We also find that incorporating histone modification and chromatin accessibility data results in additional accuracy. Surprisingly, we find that models that use no TF binding data at all, but only histone modification and chromatin accessibility data, can be as (or more) accurate than those based on in vivo TF binding data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All scripts, motifs and data presented in this article are available online at http://research.imb.uq.edu.au/t.bailey/supplementary{\_}data/McLeay2011a.},

abstract = {Rapid technological advances have led to the production of different types of biological data and enabled construction of complex networks with various types of interactions between diverse biological entities. Standard network data analysis methods were shown to be limited in dealing with such heterogeneous networked data and consequently, new methods for integrative data analyses have been proposed. The integrative methods can collectively mine multiple types of biological data and produce more holistic, systems-level biological insights. We survey recent methods for collective mining (integration) of various types of networked biological data. We compare different state-of-the-art methods for data integration and highlight their advantages and disadvantages in addressing important biological problems. We identify the important computational challenges of these methods and provide a general guideline for which methods are suited for specific biological problems, or specific data types. Moreover, we propose that recent non-negative matrix factorization-based approaches may become the integration methodology of choice, as they are well suited and accurate in dealing with heterogeneous data and have many opportunities for further development.},

@article{Ouyang2009c,
abstract = {Next-generation sequencing has greatly increased the scope and the resolution of transcriptional regulation study. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and ChIP-Seq experiments are now generating comprehensive data on transcript abundance and on regulator-DNA interactions. We propose an approach for an integrated analysis of these data based on feature extraction of ChIP-Seq signals, principal component analysis, and regression-based component selection. Compared with traditional methods, our approach not only offers higher power in predicting gene expression from ChIP-Seq data but also provides a way to capture cooperation among regulators. In mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we find that a remarkably high proportion of variation in gene expression (65{\%}) can be explained by the binding signals of 12 transcription factors (TFs). Two groups of TFs are identified. Whereas the first group (E2f1, Myc, Mycn, and Zfx) act as activators in general, the second group (Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, Smad1, Stat3, Tcfcp2l1, and Esrrb) may serve as either activator or repressor depending on the target. The two groups of TFs cooperate tightly to activate genes that are differentially up-regulated in ESCs. In the absence of binding by the first group, the binding of the second group is associated with genes that are repressed in ESCs and derepressed upon early differentiation.},
