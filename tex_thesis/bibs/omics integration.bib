abstract = {Multi-omic studies in large cohorts promise to characterize biological processes across molecular layers including genome, transcriptome, epigenome, proteome and perturbation phenotypes. However, methods for integrating multi-omic datasets are lacking. We present Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA), an unsupervised dimensionality reduction method for discovering the driving sources of variation in multi-omics data. Our model infers a set of (hidden) factors that capture biological and technical sources of variability across data modalities. We applied MOFA to data from 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) profiled for somatic mutations, RNA expression, DNA methylation and ex-vivo responses to a panel of drugs. MOFA automatically discovered the known dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) status and trisomy of chromosome 12, as well as previously underappreciated drivers of variation, such as response to oxidative stress. These factors capture key dimensions of patient heterogeneity, including those linked to clinical outcomes. Finally, MOFA handles missing data modalities in subsets of samples, enabling imputation, and the model can identify outlier samples.},

abstract = {The advent of high throughput technologies has led to a wealth of publicly available ‘omics data coming from different sources, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics. Combining such large-scale biological data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a ‘molecular signature') to explain or predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of ‘omics. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. We introduce mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous ‘omics data sets. Our recent methods extend Projection to Latent Structure (PLS) models for discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple ‘omics data or across independent studies, and for the identification of molecular signatures. We illustrate our latest mixOmics integrative frameworks for the multivariate analyses of ‘omics data available from the package.},
