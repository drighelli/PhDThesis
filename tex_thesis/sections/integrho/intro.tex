Previous chapters showed tools for multiple omics data analysis, integration and visualization using command line tools.
Even if the command line approach is pretty common inside the bioinformatics community, it is not for every scientist who is not so confident with programming languages or terminal.
Moreover, when working with multiple omics data, there is an overabundance of available tools for each sequencing that can bewilder a beginner, up to the point to renounce approaching the analysis problem.

These considerations brought us to develop \gls{igro} a web based platform for helping also non-expert users in multiple omics data analysis, integration and visualization, without loosing track of the analysis steps performed.
