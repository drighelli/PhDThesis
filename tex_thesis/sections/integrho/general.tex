Thanks to our previous experiences \cite{russo2015advantages} in developing \gls{gui}, we noticed the growing interest by the scientific community in using interactive software.
This interest is leaded by multiple motivations, such as the need to analyze data very fast or the lack of time in learning programming languages and terminal-line based tools.

Whatever is the motivation, several tools \cite{Poplawski2016} have been proposed during last years but they are oriented to analyze one specific omics or, when designed for multi-omics, they are pipeline oriented. 

In this chapter we introduce \gls{igro}, our web based platform for multi-omics data analysis and integration in a \gls{rr} spirit.
