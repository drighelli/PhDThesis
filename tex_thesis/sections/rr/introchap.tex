As previously mentioned in section \ref{sec:reprres}, in the omics data field, the complexity of the analysis, due to the data high-dimensionality and to the wide range of methodologies to use, has revived an interest in \gls{rr}, because of the difficulties in reproducing third-party scientific findings.

Basically, the implementation of the \gls{rr} is pretty complex, requiring a combination of multiple tools, each one with a different final scope.

In this Chapter we illustrate \textit{easyReporting} a novel R package for speeding up the \gls{rr} implementation when analyzing data or when constructing other packages.
