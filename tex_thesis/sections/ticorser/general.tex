When working with \gls{rnaseq} data, there are multiple aspects that can be studied, such as single nucleotide variations, alternative splicing, post-transcriptional alterations, fusion gene detections, etc.

In this chapter we focus on differentian gene expresion in time course experimental design with \gls{rnaseq} data using the \gls{tic}, a tool developed for analyzing \gls{rnaseq} time-course data.

The tool is available at: \url{https://github.com/drighelli/ticorser}
