When working with \textit{RNA-seq} data, there are multiple aspects that can be studied, such as single nucleotide variations, alternative splicing, post-transcriptional alterations, fusion gene detections, etc.


In this chapter we focus on time course experimental design with \textit{RNA-seq} data using the \gls{tic}, a tool developed for analyzing \textit{RNA-seq} time-course data.

The tool is available at: \url{https://github.com/drighelli/ticorser}
