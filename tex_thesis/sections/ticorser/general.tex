When working with \textit{RNA-seq} data, there are multiple aspect that can be studied, such as single nucleotide variations, alternative splicing, post-transcriptional alterations, fusion gene detections, etc.


In this chapter we focus on \gls{tc} experimental design with \textit{RNA-seq} data usgin \gls{tic} a tool developed for analyzing \textit{RNA-seq} time-course data.
