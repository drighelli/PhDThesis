\gls{tic} offers four different ways for analyzing time course RNA-Seq data.

Depending on the biological question under investigation we designed three different ways of interrogate the data in a time-course experiment.

Moreover, \gls{tic} offers three different ways for analyzing different biological conditions in a single time point.

To do so, we took advantage of some of the mostly used and well-performing \cite{Costa-Silva2017} R/Bioconductor packages, \textit{DESeq2}\cite{Love2014};\textit{MASigPro}\cite{Nueda2014}; \textit{edgeR}\cite{Robinson2009}; \textit{NOISeq}\cite{Tarazona2012}.

In the following sections we firstly present the Time-Course methods and then the methods for single time point gene differentiation.

\subsubsection{Time-Course DE Method 1 - \textit{LRT-TC}}
The first method (\textit{LRT-TC}) uses a \gls{lrt} to compare two different models in order to extract all those \glspl{deg} that invert their expression expression between the conditions across all the time points.

Exploiting the \gls{lrt}, as implemented in \textit{DESeq2} R/Biocnductor package, we compare two different formulas.
The first one defines the \textit{full} model where we put together the timepoints, the conditions and an interaction term between these two variables, while the second one is a reduced model where the interaction term is removed:

In so doing we are able to catch all the genes inverting their expression across the conditions along the time-course experiment. 

\[LRT \sim \frac{times+conditions+times:conditions}{times+conditions}\]


\subsubsection{Time-Course DE Method 2 - \textit{LRT-T}}
The underlying idea of the second method is the same of the first one, where the difference, here, is to remove from the \textit{reduced} formula, not only the interaction term, but also the \textit{conditions} variable.
In such a way we are able to extract all those \glspl{deg} that have different expression profiles between the conditions across all the time points.

The first formula here defines the same \textit{full} model of the first method, while the second one is the reduced model where only the times appear:

\[LRT \sim \frac{times+conditions+times:conditions}{times}\]


\subsubsection{Time-Course DE Method 3 - \textit{LRT\_NOInteraction}}
Using always the \textit{DESeq2} \gls{lrt} we defined a third method for the 
identification of \glspl{deg} that have different expression between the conditions across all the time points, but that maintain the same profile in both conditions.

Here the \textit{full} model defines the time points and the conditions variables without taking into account the interaction term, while the second the \textit{reduced} model presents only the time point variable:

\[LRT \sim \frac{times+conditions}{times}\]


%\subsubsection{Time-Course DE Method 4 - \textit{nextMASigPro}}
%
%The fourth method takes advantage of the \gls{glm} with Negative Binomial distribution as defined in the \textit{maSigPro} R/Bioconductor package.
%This method, unlike the previous ones, allows to detect all the \glspl{deg} showing any kind of differences between the conditions across all the time points.
%Indeed, as suggested by the \textit{maSigPro} authors is a good norm to cluster the genes to better understand which is their singular behaviour.


\subsubsection{Single DE Methods}

Our package offers a way to analyze the differences between the conditions at single time point, offering three different methodologies.

By using the \lstinline!differentiateConditions! function, it is possible to choose between the \textit{edgeR}, \textit{DESeq2}, \textit{NOISeq} and \textit{NOISeqBio}.

In case of \textit{edgeR} we decided to use the \textit{Quasi-Likelihood} method for the differential expression.
While when using \textit{DESeq2} for this specific case we choose the \textit{Wald} test, as suggested by the authors.

The \textit{NOISeq} package offers the possibility to discriminate between \textit{biological} and \textit{technical} replicates, applying a posterior probability in both cases.
