We presented \gls{tic}, an R command line tool for easy and fast analysis of time course \textit{RNA-seq} data, presenting a wide range of methods for differential expression data analysis and their visualization.

In the next future we programmed to implement novel functionalities 

- next masigpro
- Pathway network generation with 3Dnetwork package.
- time course oriented heatmaps
