\gls{tic} gives the possibility to analyse time course RNA-Seq data starting from \textit{BAM} files.
It enables RNA expression quantification with \lstinline!featureCounts! method producing a count matrix useful for \glspl{deg} detection.

We gave particular attention to the normalization phase, giving the possibliity not only to use several traditional normalizations methods, but also the possiblity to remove batch effect.

\gls{tic} offers four different ways for analyzing time course RNA-Seq data.

Moreover, it offers three different ways for analyzing different biological conditions in a single time point.
