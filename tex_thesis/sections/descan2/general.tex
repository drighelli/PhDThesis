\textbf{\textsl{few words on integration of epigenomic with transcriptomic}}

To investigate and to answer a epigenetic biological questions we decided to create an instrument useful for analysing the epigenomic data.
Very often the biological questions, as for the RNA-Seq, to be answered, need the comparison of two or more different biological conditions.
On this basis we designed \textit{Differential Enriched Scan 2} (\textit{DEScan2}), a software for helping the analysis of epigenomic data.
