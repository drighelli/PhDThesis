However, the package can work with any external peak caller returning results in terms of bed files, indeed the package provides additional functionalities to load BED files of peaks and handle them as GenomicRanges \cite{Lawrence2013} structures.

Furthermore, our package provides several functionalities for GenomicRanges data structure
handling. One over the others gives the possibility to split a GenomicRanges over the chromosomes
to speed-up the computations parallelizing them over the chromosomes.
