\textbf{\textsl{few words on integration of epigenomic with transcriptomic}}

To investigate and answer epigenetic biological questions we decided to create a useful instrument for analysing epigenomic data (such as \textit{ChIP-Seq}, \textit{Atac-Seq}, \textit{Sono-Seq}).
Very often the biological questions to be answered, as for the RNA-Seq, need the comparison of two or more different biological conditions.
Starting from a set of already published \cite{Koberstein2018} scripts, we designed \textit{Differential Enriched Scan 2} (\textit{DEScan2}), a software for helping the analysis of epigenomic data.
