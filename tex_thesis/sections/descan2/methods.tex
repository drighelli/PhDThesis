The package is organized in three main steps, the peak caller in section \ref{sec:descan2peakcall}, the filtering and alignment of the peaks in section \ref{sec:descan2filtering} and the peak counting described in section \ref{sec:descan2peakcounts}.

Furthermore, it offers some additional features as described in \ref{sec:descan2addfeat}.
