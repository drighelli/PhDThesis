    Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a
  technique for genome-wide profiling of DNA-binding proteins, histone
  modifications or nucleosomes. Owing to the tremendous progress in
  next-generation sequencing technology, ChIP-seq offers higher resolution,
  less noise and greater coverage than its array-based predecessor ChIP-chip.
  With the decreasing cost of sequencing, ChIP-seq has become an indispensable
  tool for studying gene regulation and epigenetic mechanisms. In this Review,
  I describe the benefits and challenges in harnessing this technique with an
  emphasis on issues related to experimental design and data analysis. ChIP-seq
  experiments generate large quantities of data, and effective computational
  analysis will be crucial for uncovering biological mechanisms.%

    The modulation of DNA-protein interactions by methylation of
  protein-binding sites in DNA and the occurrence in genomic imprinting, X
  chromosome inactivation, and fragile X syndrome of different methylation
  patterns in DNA of different chromosomal origin have underlined the need to
  establish methylation patterns in individual strands of particular genomic
  sequences. We report a genomic sequencing method that provides positive
  identification of 5-methylcytosine residues and yields strand-specific
  sequences of individual molecules in genomic DNA. The method utilizes
  bisulfite-induced modification of genomic DNA, under conditions whereby
  cytosine is converted to uracil, but 5-methylcytosine remains nonreactive.
  The sequence under investigation is then amplified by PCR with two sets of
  strand-specific primers to yield a pair of fragments, one from each strand,
  in which all uracil and thymine residues have been amplified as thymine and
  only 5-methylcytosine residues have been amplified as cytosine. The PCR
  products can be sequenced directly to provide a strand-specific average
  sequence for the population of molecules or can be cloned and sequenced to
  provide methylation maps of single DNA molecules. We tested the method by
  defining the methylation status within single DNA strands of two closely
  spaced CpG dinucleotides in the promoter of the human kininogen gene. During
  the analysis, we encountered in sperm DNA an unusual methylation pattern,
  which suggests that the high methylation level of single-copy sequences in
  sperm may be locally modulated by binding of protein factors in germ-line
  cells.%

    We describe an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing

  genomic locations of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins, individual
  nucleosomes and chromatin compaction at nucleotide resolution. We discovered
  classes of DNA-binding factors that strictly avoided, could tolerate or
  tended to overlap with nucleosomes. Using ATAC-seq maps of human CD4(+) T

    \field{abstract}{%
    The three-dimensional folding of chromosomes compartmentalizes the genome
  and and can bring distant functional elements, such as promoters and
  enhancers, into close spatial proximity (2-6). Deciphering the relationship
  between chromosome organization and genome activity will aid in understanding
  genomic processes, like transcription and replication. However, little is
  known about how chromosomes fold. Microscopy is unable to distinguish large
  numbers of loci simultaneously or at high resolution. To date, the detection
  of chromosomal interactions using chromosome conformation capture (3C) and
  its subsequent adaptations required the choice of a set of target loci,
  making genome-wide studies impossible (7-10). We developed Hi-C, an extension
  of 3C that is capable of identifying long range interactions in an unbiased,
  genome-wide fashion. In Hi-C, cells are fixed with formaldehyde, causing
  interacting loci to be bound to one another by means of covalent DNA-protein
  cross-links. When the DNA is subsequently fragmented with a restriction
  enzyme, these loci remain linked. A biotinylated residue is incorporated as
  the 5' overhangs are filled in. Next, blunt-end ligation is performed under
  dilute conditions that favor ligation events between cross-linked DNA
  fragments. This results in a genome-wide library of ligation products,
  corresponding to pairs of fragments that were originally in close proximity
  to each other in the nucleus. Each ligation product is marked with biotin at
  the site of the junction. The library is sheared, and the junctions are
  pulled-down with streptavidin beads. The purified junctions can subsequently
  be analyzed using a high-throughput sequencer, resulting in a catalog of
  interacting fragments. Direct analysis of the resulting contact matrix
  reveals numerous features of genomic organization, such as the presence of
  chromosome territories and the preferential association of small gene-rich
  chromosomes. Correlation analysis can be applied to the contact matrix,
  demonstrating that the human genome is segregated into two compartments: a
  less densely packed compartment containing open, accessible, and active
  chromatin and a more dense compartment containing closed, inaccessible, and
  inactive chromatin regions. Finally, ensemble analysis of the contact matrix,
  coupled with theoretical derivations and computational simulations, revealed
  that at the megabase scale Hi-C reveals features consistent with a fractal
  globule conformation.%

    MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a
  challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript
  structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput
  of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer
  from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and
  mapping biases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To align our large
  ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we
  developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software
  based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses
  sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays
  followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other
  aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the
  human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest
  12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and
  precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions,
  STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts,
  and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454
  sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we
  experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an
  80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping
  strategy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is
  implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source software
  distributed under GPLv3 license and can be downloaded from
  http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/.%

    HISAT (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of transcripts) is a
  highly efficient system for aligning reads from RNA sequencing experiments.
  HISAT uses an indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform and the
  Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, employing two types of indexes for alignment: a
  whole-genome FM index to anchor each alignment and numerous local FM indexes
  for very rapid extensions of these alignments. HISAT's hierarchical index for
  the human genome contains 48,000 local FM indexes, each representing a
  genomic region of ∼64,000 bp. Tests on real and simulated data sets showed
  that HISAT is the fastest system currently available, with equal or better
  accuracy than any other method. Despite its large number of indexes, HISAT
  requires only 4.3 gigabytes of memory. HISAT supports genomes of any size,
  including those larger than 4 billion bases.%

    TopHat is a popular spliced aligner for RNA-sequence (RNA-seq) experiments.
  In this paper, we describe TopHat2, which incorporates many significant
  enhancements to TopHat. TopHat2 can align reads of various lengths produced
  by the latest sequencing technologies, while allowing for variable-length
  indels with respect to the reference genome. In addition to de novo spliced
  alignment, TopHat2 can align reads across fusion breaks, which can occur
  after genomic translocations. TopHat2 combines the ability to identify novel
  splice sites with direct mapping to known transcripts, producing sensitive
  and accurate alignments, even for highly repetitive genomes or in the
  presence of pseudogenes. TopHat2 is available at
  http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat.%

    SUMMARY: The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format is a generic alignment
  format for storing read alignments against reference sequences, supporting
  short and long reads (up to 128 Mbp) produced by different sequencing
  platforms. It is flexible in style, compact in size, efficient in random
  access and is the format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project
  are released. SAMtools implements various utilities for post-processing
  alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing, variant caller and alignment
  viewer, and thus provides universal tools for processing read alignments.

    Motivation: Most existing methods for DNA sequence analysis rely on
  accurate sequences or genotypes. However, in applications of the
  next-generation sequencing (NGS), accurate genotypes may not be easily
  obtained (e.g. multi-sample low-coverage sequencing or somatic mutation
  discovery). These applications press for the development of new methods for
  analyzing sequence data with uncertainty. Results: We present a statistical
  framework for calling SNPs, discovering somatic mutations, inferring
  population genetical parameters and performing association tests directly
  based on sequencing data without explicit genotyping or linkage-based
  imputation. On real data, we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable
  accuracy to alternative methods for estimating site allele count, for
  inferring allele frequency spectrum and for association mapping. We also
  highlight the necessity of using symmetric datasets for finding somatic
  mutations and confirm that for discovering rare events, mismapping is
  frequently the leading source of errors. Availability:

    Ten years ago next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies appeared on the
  market. During the past decade, tremendous progress has been made in terms of

  development of a large number of novel NGS applications in basic science as

    {\textless}p{\textgreater}In recent years, the introduction of massively
  parallel sequencing platforms for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) protocols,
  able to simultaneously sequence hundred thousand DNA fragments, dramatically
  changed the landscape of the genetics studies. RNA-Seq for transcriptome
  studies, Chip-Seq for DNA-proteins interaction, CNV-Seq for large genome
  nucleotide variations are only some of the intriguing new applications
  supported by these innovative platforms. Among them RNA-Seq is perhaps the
  most complex NGS application. Expression levels of specific genes,
  differential splicing, allele-specific expression of transcripts can be
  accurately determined by RNA-Seq experiments to address many
  biological-related issues. All these attributes are not readily achievable
  from previously widespread hybridization-based or tag sequence-based
  approaches. However, the unprecedented level of sensitivity and the large
  amount of available data produced by NGS platforms provide clear advantages
  as well as new challenges and issues. This technology brings the great power
  to make several new biological observations and discoveries, it also requires
  a considerable effort in the development of new bioinformatics tools to deal
  with these massive data files. The paper aims to give a survey of the RNA-Seq
  methodology, particularly focusing on the challenges that this application

    The availability of the human genome sequence has allowed identification of
  disease-causing mutations in many Mendelian disorders, and detection of
  significant associations of nucleotide polymorphisms to complex diseases and
  traits. Despite these progresses, finding the causative variations for most
  of the common diseases remains a complex task. Several studies have shown
  gene expression analyses provide a quite unbiased way to investigate complex
  traits and common disorders' pathogenesis. Therefore, whole-transcriptome
  analysis is increasingly acquiring a key role in the knowledge of mechanisms
  responsible for complex diseases. Hybridization-and tag-based technologies
  have elucidated the involvement of multiple genes and pathways in
  pathological conditions, providing insights into the expression of thousand
  of coding and noncoding RNAs, such as microRNAs. However, the introduction of
  Next-Generation Sequencing, particularly of RNA-Seq, has overcome some
  drawbacks of previously used technologies. Identifying, in a single
  experiment, potentially novel genes/exons and splice isoforms, RNA editing,
  fusion transcripts and allele-specific expression are some of its advantages.
  RNA-Seq has been fruitfully applied to study cancer and host-pathogens
  interactions, and it is taking first steps for studying neurodegenerative
  diseases (ND) as well as neuropsychiatric diseases. In addition, it is
  emerging as a very powerful tool to study quantitative trait loci associated
  with gene expression in complex diseases. This paper provides an overview on
  gene expression profiling of complex diseases, with emphasis on RNA-Seq, its
  advantages over conventional technologies for studying cancer and ND, and for
  linking nucleotide variations to gene expression changes, also discussing its
  limitations.%

    High-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) promises simultaneous transcript
  discovery and abundance estimation. However, this would require algorithms
  that are not restricted by prior gene annotations and that account for
  alternative transcription and splicing. Here we introduce such algorithms in
  an open-source software program called Cufflinks. To test Cufflinks, we
  sequenced and analyzed {\textgreater}430 million paired 75-bp RNA-Seq reads
  from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We
  detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones,
  62{\%} of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous
  genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete
  switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform,
  and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results
  suggest that Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility
  and complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that
  it can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation.%

    Differential analysis of gene and transcript expression using
  high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is complicated by several sources of
  measurement variability and poses numerous statistical challenges. We present
  Cuffdiff 2, an algorithm that estimates expression at transcript-level
  resolution and controls for variability evident across replicate libraries.
  Cuffdiff 2 robustly identifies differentially expressed transcripts and genes
  and reveals differential splicing and promoter-preference changes. We
  demonstrate the accuracy of our approach through differential analysis of
  lung fibroblasts in response to loss of the developmental transcription
  factor HOXA1, which we show is required for lung fibroblast and HeLa cell
  cycle progression. Loss of HOXA1 results in significant expression level
  changes in thousands of individual transcripts, along with isoform switching
  events in key regulators of the cell cycle. Cuffdiff 2 performs robust
  differential analysis in RNA-seq experiments at transcript resolution,
  revealing a layer of regulation not readily observable with other
  high-throughput technologies.%

    Genome-wide measurements of protein-DNA interactions and transcriptomes are
  increasingly done by deep DNA sequencing methods (ChIP-seq and RNA-seq). The
  power and richness of these counting-based measurements comes at the cost of
  routinely handling tens to hundreds of millions of reads. Whereas early
  adopters necessarily developed their own custom computer code to analyze the
  first ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets, a new generation of more sophisticated
  algorithms and software tools are emerging to assist in the analysis phase of
  these projects. Here we describe the multilayered analyses of ChIP-seq and
  RNA-seq datasets, discuss the software packages currently available to
  perform tasks at each layer and describe some upcoming challenges and
  features for future analysis tools. We also discuss how software choices and
  uses are affected by specific aspects of the underlying biology and data
  structure, including genome size, positional clustering of transcription
  factor binding sites, transcript discovery and expression quantification.%

    The vertebrate body is built on a metameric organization which consists of
  a repetition of functionally equivalent units, each comprising a vertebra,
  its associated muscles, peripheral nerves and blood vessels. This periodic
  pattern is established during embryogenesis by the somitogenesis process.
  Somites are generated in a rhythmic fashion from the presomitic mesoderm and
  they subsequently differentiate to give rise to the vertebrae and skeletal
  muscles of the body. Somitogenesis has been very actively studied in the
  chick embryo since the 19th century and many of the landmark experiments that
  led to our current understanding of the vertebrate segmentation process have
  been performed in this organism. Somite formation involves an oscillator, the
  segmentation clock whose periodic signal is converted into the periodic array
  of somite boundaries by a spacing mechanism relying on a traveling threshold
  of FGF signaling regressing in concert with body axis extension. ?? 2004

  of the DNA minor groove as it wraps around histones. Here, we use DNase-seq
  data from 49 samples representing diverse cell types to reveal this digestion
  pattern at individual loci and predict genomic locations where nucleosome
  rotational positioning, the orientation of DNA with respect to the histone
  surface, is stably maintained. We call these regions DNase I annotated
  regions of nucleosome stability (DARNS). Compared to MNase-seq experiments,
  we show DARNS correspond well to annotated nucleosomes. Interestingly, many
  DARNS are positioned over only one side of annotated nucleosomes, suggesting
  that the periodic digestion pattern attenuates over the nucleosome dyad.
  DARNS reproduce the arrangement of nucleosomes around transcription start
  sites and are depleted at ubiquitous DHS sites. We also generated DARNS from
  multiple lymphoblast cell line (LCL) samples. We found that LCL DARNS were
  enriched at DHS sites present in most of the original 49 samples but absent
  in LCLs, while multi-cell-type DARNS were enriched at LCL-specific DHS sites.
  This indicates that variably open DHS sites are often occupied by
  rotationally stable nucleosomes in cell types where the DHS site is closed.
  DARNS provide additional information about precise DNA orientation within
  individual nucleosomes not available from other nucleosome positioning assays
  and contribute to understanding the role of chromatin in gene regulation.%

    Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder
  that is associated with genetic risk factors. Most human disease-associated
  single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are not located in genes but rather
  are in regulatory regions that control gene expression. The function of
  regulatory regions is determined through epigenetic mechanisms. Parallels
  between the cellular basis of development and the formation of long-term
  memory have long been recognized, particularly the role of epigenetic
  mechanisms in both processes. We analyzed how learning alters chromatin
  accessibility in the mouse hippocampus using a new high-throughput sequencing
  bioinformatics strategy we call DEScan (differential enrichment scan).
  DEScan, which enabled the analysis of data from epigenomic experiments
  containing multiple replicates, revealed changes in chromatin accessibility
  at 2365 regulatory regions-most of which were promoters. Learning-regulated
  promoters were active during forebrain development in mice and were enriched
  in epigenetic modifications indicative of bivalent promoters. These promoters
  were disproportionally intronic, showed a complex relationship with gene
  expression and alternative splicing during memory consolidation and
  retrieval, and were enriched in the data set relative to known ASD risk
  genes. Genotyping in a clinical cohort within one of these promoters (SHANK3
  promoter 6) revealed that the SNP rs6010065 was associated with ASD. Our data
  support the idea that learning recapitulates development at the epigenetic
  level and demonstrate that behaviorally induced epigenetic changes in mice
  can highlight regulatory regions relevant to brain disorders in patients.%

    ATAC-seq (Assays for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) is
  a recently developed technique for genome-wide analysis of chromatin
  accessibility. Compared to earlier methods for assaying chromatin
  accessibility, ATAC-seq is faster and easier to perform, does not require
  cross-linking, has higher signal to noise ratio, and can be performed on
  small cell numbers. However, to ensure a successful ATAC-seq experiment,
  step-by-step quality assurance processes, including both wet lab quality
  control and in silico quality assessment, are essential. While several tools
  have been developed or adopted for assessing read quality, identifying
  nucleosome occupancy and accessible regions from ATAC-seq data, none of the
  tools provide a comprehensive set of functionalities for preprocessing and
  quality assessment of aligned ATAC-seq datasets. We have developed a
  Bioconductor package, ATACseqQC, for easily generating various diagnostic
  plots to help researchers quickly assess the quality of their ATAC-seq data.
  In addition, this package contains functions to preprocess aligned ATAC-seq
  data for subsequent peak calling. Here we demonstrate the utilities of our
  package using 25 publicly available ATAC-seq datasets from four studies. We
  also provide guidelines on what the diagnostic plots should look like for an
  ideal ATAC-seq dataset. This software package has been used successfully for
  preprocessing and assessing several in-house and public ATAC-seq datasets.
  Diagnostic plots generated by this package will facilitate the quality
  assessment of ATAC-seq data, and help researchers to evaluate their own
  ATAC-seq experiments as well as select high-quality ATAC-seq datasets from
  public repositories such as GEO to avoid generating hypotheses or drawing
  conclusions from low-quality ATAC-seq experiments. The software, source code,
  and documentation are freely available as a Bioconductor package at
  https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ATACseqQC.html .%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The advent of high throughput technologies has led to a wealth of publicly
  available biological data coming from different sources, the so-called 'omics
  data (transcriptomics for the study of transcripts, proteomics for proteins,
  metabolomics for metabolites, etc). Combining such large-scale biological
  data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights,
  provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner.
  Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small
  subsets of molecules (a 'molecular signature') that explains or predicts
  biological conditions, but mainly for the analysis of a single data set. In
  addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological
  feature independently. In contrast, linear multivariate methods adopt a
  system biology approach by statistically integrating several data sets at
  once and offer an unprecedented opportunity to probe relationships between
  heterogeneous data sets measured at multiple functional levels. mixOmics is
  an R package which provides a wide range of linear multivariate methods for
  data exploration, integration, dimension reduction and visualisation of
  biological data sets. The methods we have developed extend Projection to
  Latent Structure (PLS) models for discriminant analysis and data integration
  and include l1 penalisations to identify molecular signatures. Here we
  introduce the mixOmics methods specifically developed to integrate large data
  sets, either at the N-level, where the same individuals are profiled using
  different 'omics platforms (same N), or at the P-level, where independent
  studies including different individuals are generated under similar
  biological conditions using the same 'omics platform (same P). In both cases,
  the main challenge to face is data heterogeneity, due to inherent
  platform-specific artefacts (N-integration), or systematic differences
  arising from experiments assayed at different geographical sites or different
  times (P-integration). We present and illustrate those novel multivariate
  methods on existing 'omics data available from the package.%

    Multi-omics studies promise the improved characterization of biological
  processes across molecular layers. However, methods for the unsupervised
  integration of the resulting heterogeneous data sets are lacking. We present
  Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA), a computational method for discovering
  the principal sources of variation in multi-omics data sets. MOFA infers a
  set of (hidden) factors that capture biological and technical sources of
  variability. It disentangles axes of heterogeneity that are shared across
  multiple modalities and those specific to individual data modalities. The
  learnt factors enable a variety of downstream analyses, including
  identification of sample subgroups, data imputation and the detection of
  outlier samples. We applied MOFA to a cohort of 200 patient samples of
  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, RNA
  expression, DNA methylation and ex vivo drug responses. MOFA identified
  major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin
  heavy-chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously
  underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress. In a second
  application, we used MOFA to analyse single-cell multi-omics data,
  identifying coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic changes along cell
  differentiation.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In recent years, next generation sequencing (NGS) has gradually replaced
  microarray as the major platform in measuring gene expressions. Compared to
  microarray, NGS has many advantages, such as less noise and higher
  throughput. However, the discreteness of NGS data also challenges the
  existing statistical methodology. In particular, there still lacks an
  appropriate statistical method for reconstructing gene regulatory networks
  using NGS data in the literature. The existing local Poisson graphical model
  method is not consistent and can only infer certain local structures of the
  network. In this article, we propose a random effect model-based
  transformation to continuize NGS data and then we transform the continuized
  data to Gaussian via a semiparametric transformation and apply an equivalent
  partial correlation selection method to reconstruct gene regulatory networks.
  The proposed method is consistent. The numerical results indicate that the
  proposed method can lead to much more accurate inference of gene regulatory
  networks than the local Poisson graphical model and other existing methods.
  The proposed data-continuized transformation fills the theoretical gap for
  how to transform discrete data to continuous data and facilitates NGS data
  analysis. The proposed data-continuized transformation also makes it feasible
  to integrate different types of data, such as microarray and RNA-seq data, in
  reconstruction of gene regulatory networks.%

    State-of-the-art next-generation sequencing, transcriptomics, proteomics
  and other high-throughput 'omics' technologies enable the efficient
  generation of large experimental data sets. These data may yield
  unprecedented knowledge about molecular pathways in cells and their role in

  reduction approaches for simultaneous exploratory analyses of multiple data
  sets. These methods extract the linear relationships that best explain the
  correlated structure across data sets, the variability both within and
  between variables (or observations) and may highlight data issues such as
  batch effects or outliers. We explore dimension reduction techniques as one

    The University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser is a popular
  Web-based tool for quickly displaying a requested portion of a genome at any
  scale, accompanied by a series of aligned annotation "tracks." The
  annotations-generated by the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group and external
  collaborators-display gene predictions, mRNA and expressed sequence tag
  alignments, simple nucleotide polymorphisms, expression and regulatory data,
  phenotype and variation data, and pairwise and multiple-species comparative
  genomics data. All information relevant to a region is presented in one
  window, facilitating biological analysis and interpretation. The database
  tables underlying the Genome Browser tracks can be viewed, downloaded, and
  manipulated using another Web-based application, the UCSC Table Browser.
  Users can upload data as custom annotation tracks in both browsers for

    To the Editor:$\backslash$nRapid improvements in sequencing and array-based
  platforms are resulting in a flood of diverse genome-wide data, including
  data from exome and whole-genome sequencing, epigenetic surveys, expression
  profiling of coding and noncoding RNAs, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
  and copy number profiling, and functional assays. Analysis of these large,
  diverse data sets holds the promise of a more comprehensive understanding of
  the genome and its relation to human disease. Experienced and knowledgeable
  human review is an essential component of this process, complementing
  computational approaches. This calls for efficient and intuitive
  visualization tools able to scale to very large data sets and to flexibly
  integrate multiple data types, including clinical data. However, the sheer
  volume and scope of data pose a significant challenge to the development of

    Data visualization is an essential component of genomic data analysis.
  However, the size and diversity of the data sets produced by today's
  sequencing and array-based profiling methods present major challenges to
  visualization tools. The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a
  high-performance viewer that efficiently handles large heterogeneous data
  sets, while providing a smooth and intuitive user experience at all levels of
  genome resolution. A key characteristic of IGV is its focus on the
  integrative nature of genomic studies, with support for both array-based and
  next-generation sequencing data, and the integration of clinical and
  phenotypic data. Although IGV is often used to view genomic data from public
  sources, its primary emphasis is to support researchers who wish to visualize
  and explore their own data sets or those from colleagues. To that end, IGV
  supports flexible loading of local and remote data sets, and is optimized to
  provide high-performance data visualization and exploration on standard
  desktop systems. IGV is freely available for download from

    Recent technologies have made it cost-effective to collect diverse types of
  genome-wide data. Computational methods are needed to combine these data to
  create a comprehensive view of a given disease or a biological process.
  Similarity network fusion (SNF) solves this problem by constructing networks
  of samples (e.g., patients) for each available data type and then efficiently
  fusing these into one network that represents the full spectrum of underlying
  data. For example, to create a comprehensive view of a disease given a cohort
  of patients, SNF computes and fuses patient similarity networks obtained from
  each of their data types separately, taking advantage of the complementarity
  in the data. We used SNF to combine mRNA expression, DNA methylation and
  microRNA (miRNA) expression data for five cancer data sets. SNF substantially
  outperforms single data type analysis and established integrative approaches
  when identifying cancer subtypes and is effective for predicting survival.%

    High-throughput biological assays such as microarrays let us ask very
  detailed questions about how diseases operate, and promise to let us
  personalize therapy. Data processing, however, is often not described well
  enough to allow for exact reproduction of the results, leading to exercises
  in "forensic bioinformatics" where aspects of raw data and reported results
  are used to infer what methods must have been employed. Unfortunately, poor
  documentation can shift from an inconvenience to an active danger when it
  obscures not just methods but errors. In this report we examine several
  related papers purporting to use microarray-based signatures of drug
  sensitivity derived from cell lines to predict patient response. Patients in
  clinical trials are currently being allocated to treatment arms on the basis
  of these results. However, we show in five case studies that the results
  incorporate several simple errors that may be putting patients at risk. One
  theme that emerges is that the most common errors are simple (e.g., row or
  column offsets); conversely, it is our experience that the most simple errors
  are common. We then discuss steps we are taking to avoid such errors in our
  own investigations.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The articles in this special issue provide independent solutions for
  practical reproducible research systems. The use of Matlab-based tools such
  as the famous Wavelab and Sparselab packages in promoting reproducible
  research in computational harmonic analysis has been presented. In
  particular, the authors point to the success of the reproducible research
  discipline in increasing the reliability of computational research and
  reflect on the effort necessary for implementing this discipline in a
  research group and overcoming possible objections to it. An article also
  describes a Python interface to the well-known Clawpack package for solving
  hyperbolic partial differential equations that appear in wave propagation
  problems. The author argues strongly in favor of reproducible computations
  and shows an example using a simplified Python interface to Fortran code. An
  article also represents the field of bioinformatics, which has been a
  stronghold of reproducible research. It describes the cacher package, which
  is built on top of the R computing environment. Cacher enables a modular
  approach to reproducible computations by storing results of intermediate
  computations in a database. The special issue ends with an article on the
  legal aspects of reproducible research, including copyright and licensing
  issues.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Vaccination is the most successful and cost-effective method to prevent
  infectious diseases. However, many vaccine antigens have poor in vivo
  immunogenic potential and need adjuvants to enhance immune response. The
  application of systems biology to immunity and vaccinology has yielded
  crucial insights about how vaccines and adjuvants work. We have previously
  characterized two safe and powerful delivery systems derived from
  non-pathogenic prokaryotic organisms: E2 and fd filamentous bacteriophage
  systems. They elicit an in vivo immune response inducing CD8+ T-cell
  responses, even in absence of adjuvants or stimuli for dendritic cells'
  maturation. Nonetheless, a systematic and comparative analysis of the complex
  gene expression network underlying such activation is missing. Therefore, we
  compared the transcriptomes of ex vivo isolated bone marrow-derived dendritic
  cells exposed to these antigen delivery systems. Significant differences
  emerged, especially for genes involved in innate immunity, co-stimulation,
  and cytokine production. Results indicate that E2 drives polarization toward
  the Th2 phenotype, mainly mediated by Irf4, Ccl17, and Ccr4 over-expression.
  Conversely, fd-sc$\alpha$DEC-205 triggers Th1 T cells' polarization through
  the induction of Il12b, Il12rb, Il6, and other molecules involved in its
  signal transduction. The data analysis was performed using RNASeqGUI, hence,
  addressing the increasing need of transparency and reproducibility of
  computational analysis.%

    BACKGROUND: Semantic Web technologies have been widely applied in the life
  sciences, for example by data providers such as OpenLifeData and through web
  services frameworks such as SADI. The recently reported OpenLifeData2SADI
  project offers access to the vast OpenLifeData data store through SADI
  services.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFINDINGS: This article describes how to
  merge data retrieved from OpenLifeData2SADI with other SADI services using
  the Galaxy bioinformatics analysis platform, thus making this semantic data
  more amenable to complex analyses. This is demonstrated using a working
  example, which is made distributable and reproducible through a Docker image
  that includes SADI tools, along with the data and workflows that constitute
  the demonstration.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The combination of
  Galaxy and Docker offers a solution for faithfully reproducing and sharing
  complex data retrieval and analysis workflows based on the SADI Semantic web
  service design patterns.%

    There is a growing movement to encourage reproducibility and transparency
  practices in the scientific community, including public access to raw data
  and protocols, the conduct of replication studies, systematic integration of
  evidence in systematic reviews, and the documentation of funding and
  potential conflicts of interest. In this survey, we assessed the current
  status of reproducibility and transparency addressing these indicators in a
  random sample of 441 biomedical journal articles published in 2000-2014. Only
  one study provided a full protocol and none made all raw data directly
  available. Replication studies were rare (n = 4), and only 16 studies had
  their data included in a subsequent systematic review or meta-analysis. The
  majority of studies did not mention anything about funding or conflicts of
  interest. The percentage of articles with no statement of conflict decreased
  substantially between 2000 and 2014 (94.4{\%} in 2000 to 34.6{\%} in 2014);
  the percentage of articles reporting statements of conflicts (0{\%} in 2000,
  15.4{\%} in 2014) or no conflicts (5.6{\%} in 2000, 50.0{\%} in 2014)
  increased. Articles published in journals in the clinical medicine category
  versus other fields were almost twice as likely to not include any
  information on funding and to have private funding. This study provides
  baseline data to compare future progress in improving these indicators in the
  scientific literature.%

    Next-generation sequencing technologies generate millions of short sequence
  reads, which are usually aligned to a reference genome. In many applications,
  the key information required for downstream analysis is the number of reads
  mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene. The
  process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read summarization is
  required for a great variety of genomic analyses but has so far received
  relatively little attention in the literature. We present featureCounts, a
  read summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either
  RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts implements highly
  efficient chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques. It is
  considerably faster than existing methods (by an order of magnitude for
  gene-level summarization) and requires far less computer memory. It works
  with either single or paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options
  appropriate for different sequencing applications. featureCounts is available

    We compare methods for filtering RNA-seq lowexpression genes and
  investigate the effect of filtering on detection of differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs). Although RNA-seq technology has improved the dynamic range of
  gene expression quantification, low-expression genes may be indistinguishable
  from sampling noise. The presence of noisy, low-expression genes can decrease
  the sensitivity of detecting DEGs. Thus, identification and filtering of
  these low-expression genes may improve DEG detection sensitivity. Using the
  SEQC benchmark dataset, we investigate the effect of different filtering
  methods on DEG detection sensitivity. Moreover, we investigate the effect of
  RNA-seq pipelines on optimal filtering thresholds. Results indicate that the
  filtering threshold that maximizes the total number of DEGs closely
  corresponds to the threshold that maximizes DEG detection sensitivity.
  Transcriptome reference annotation, expression quantification method, and DEG
  detection method are statistically significant RNA-seq pipeline factors that
  affect the optimal filtering threshold.%

    http://bioinfo.cipf.es/aconesa Introduction Next Generation Sequencing
  (NGS) technologies have brought a revolution to research in genome and genome
  regulation. One of the most breaking applications of NGS is in transcriptome
  analysis. RNA-seq has revealed exciting new data on gene models, alternative
  splicing and extra-genic expression. Also RNA-seq permits the quantification
  of gene expression across a large dynamic range and with more reproducibility
  than microarrays. Several methods for the assessment of differential
  expression from count data have been proposed but biases associated to
  transcript length and transcript frequency distributions have been reported.
  It is still not clear how much sequencing reads should be generated in a
  RNA-seq experiment to obtain reliable results and what's exactly being
  detected. In general we observed that many RNA-seq datasets have not reached
  saturation for detection of expressed genes and that the relative proportion
  of different transcript biotypes changes with increasing sequencing depth. In
  this work we investigate the effect that library size has on the assessment
  of differential expression on different aspects of the selected genes. We
  show that current statistical methods suffer from a strong dependency of
  their significant calls on the number of mapped reads considered and proposed
  a novel differential expression methodology – NOISeq1- that is robust to
  the amount of reads. Results NOISeq is a non-parametric approach for the
  differential expression analysis of RNseq-data. NOISeq creates a null or
  noise distribution of count changes by comparing the number of reads of each
  gene in samples within the same condition. This reference distribution is
  then used to assess whether the change in count number between two conditions
  for a given gene is likely to be part of the noise or represents a true
  differential expression. Two variants of the method are implemented:
  NOISeq-real uses replicates, when available, to compute the noise
  distribution and, NOISeq-sim simulates them in absence of replication. We
  compared our method with edgeR2, DESeq3, baySeq4 and Fisher Exact Test (FET)
  using three different experimental datasets. Results are presented for MAQC
  experiment where the transcriptome of brain and Universal Human Reference
  (HUR) samples were sequenced at about 45 million Solexa reads each. We first
  determined that although protein-coding gene is the most abundant transcript
  type within differential expression calls for all methodologies, other RNA
  types, such as processed-transcript, pseudogenes and lincRNAs are readily
  detected. NOISeq dected comparatively more protein-coding genes than other
  methods that called significant a considerable number of non-coding and small
  RNA transcripts. Additionally, all comparing methods except FET greatly
  increased the number of detected (non-coding) genes as sequencing depth
  raised while NOISeq showed a constant pattern. Also these other methods tend
  to select shorter genes and smaller fold change differences with the
  increasing amounts of reads. In general, parametric approaches selected much
  more genes than NOISeq, specially at high sequencing depth rates. When
  analyzing the functional content of these genes by functional enrichment
  analysis, we observed that the pool of genes detected both by NOISeq and the
  parametric methods where highly enriched in functional categories, while
  genes selected only by parametric methods did not. To check whether this
  differences were indicative of different false calls between methods, we used
  the RT-PCR data available at the MAQC project that contains 330 true positive
  and 83 true negative differentially expressed genes. Performance plots
  indicate that edgeR, DESeq, baySeq strongly increased the number of false
  calls with sequencing depth, while NOISeq was constant and low. On the
  contrary true discoveries were slightly better for these methods, presumably
  consequence of their large number of selected genes. FET showed in low false
  and true discovery rates, due to its general lower detection power.
  Conclusions We showed that most current RNA-seq statistical analysis methods
  fail to control the number of false discoveries as the size of the sequenced
  library increases. These false positive are mainly short, non- coding genes
  and/or genes with small fold changes. NOISeq, but adopting an empirical
  approach to model the null distribution of differential expression captures
  better the shape of noise in RNA-seq data, resulting in a sequencing-depth
  robust method for differential expression analysis. References 1. Tarazona

    Normalization of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data has proven essential to
  ensure accurate inference of expression levels. Here, we show that usual

  correct for library preparation and other more complex unwanted technical
  effects. We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control Consortium
  (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the possibility of using them
  directly for normalization. We show that the spike-ins are not reliable
  enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based
  normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove
  unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by
  performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC
  spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more
  accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential
  expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods. In particular,
  RUV promises to be valuable for large collaborative projects involving
  multiple laboratories, technicians, and/or sequencing platforms.%

    The correct identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between
  specific conditions is a key in the understanding phenotypic variation.
  High-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the main option
  for these studies. Thus, the number of methods and softwares for differential
  expression analysis from RNA-Seq data also increased rapidly. However, there
  is no consensus about the most appropriate pipeline or protocol for
  identifying differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq data. This work
  presents an extended review on the topic that includes the evaluation of six
  methods of mapping reads, including pseudo-alignment and quasi-mapping and
  nine methods of differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq data. The
  adopted methods were evaluated based on real RNA-Seq data, using qRT-PCR data
  as reference (gold-standard). As part of the results, we developed a software
  that performs all the analysis presented in this work, which is freely
  available at https://github.com/costasilvati/consexpression. The results
  indicated that mapping methods have minimal impact on the final DEGs
  analysis, considering that adopted data have an annotated reference genome.
  Regarding the adopted experimental model, the DEGs identification methods
  that have more consistent results were the limma+voom, NOIseq and DESeq2.
  Additionally, the consensus among five DEGs identification methods guarantees
  a list of DEGs with great accuracy, indicating that the combination of
  different methods can produce more suitable results. The consensus option is
  also included for use in the available software.%

    In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the
  analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence
  of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate
  numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers
  require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for
  differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for
  dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of
  estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength
  rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package

    MOTIVATION The widespread adoption of RNA-seq to quantitatively measure
  gene expression has increased the scope of sequencing experimental designs to
  include time-course experiments. maSigPro is an R package specifically suited
  for the analysis of time-course gene expression data, which was developed
  originally for microarrays and hence was limited in its application to count
  data. RESULTS We have updated maSigPro to support RNA-seq time series
  analysis by introducing generalized linear models in the algorithm to support
  the modeling of count data while maintaining the traditional functionalities
  of the package. We show a good performance of the maSigPro-GLM method in
  several simulated time-course scenarios and in a real experimental dataset.

    Motivation: Digital gene expression (DGE) technologies measure gene
  expression by counting sequence tags. They are sensitive technologies for
  measuring gene expression on a genomic scale, without the need for prior
  knowledge of the genome sequence. As the cost of sequencing DNA decreases,
  the number of DGE datasets is expected to grow
  dramatically.$\backslash$nVarious tests of differential expression have been
  proposed for replicated DGE data using binomial, Poisson, negative binomial
  or pseudo-likelihood (PL) models for the counts, but none of the these are
  usable when the number of replicates is very small.$\backslash$nResults: We
  develop tests using the negative binomial distribution to model
  overdispersion relative to the Poisson, and use conditional weighted
  likelihood to moderate the level of overdispersion across genes. Not only is
  our strategy applicable even with the smallest number of libraries, but it
  also proves to be more powerful than previous strategies when more libraries
  are available. The methodology is equally applicable to other counting
  technologies, such as proteomic spectral counts.$\backslash$nAvailability: An

    KEGG (http://www.kegg.jp/ or http://www.genome.jp/ kegg/) is an integrated
  database resource for biolog-ical interpretation of genome sequences and
  other high-throughput data. Molecular functions of genes and proteins are
  associated with ortholog groups and stored in the KEGG Orthology (KO)
  database. The KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies and KEGG modules are
  developed as networks of KO nodes, representing high-level functions of the
  cell and the organism. Currently, more than 4000 com-plete genomes are
  annotated with KOs in the KEGG GENES database, which can be used as a
  refer-ence data set for KO assignment and subsequent reconstruction of KEGG
  pathways and other molec-ular networks. As an annotation resource, the
  fol-lowing improvements have been made. First, each KO record is re-examined
  and associated with pro-tein sequence data used in experiments of func-tional
  characterization. Second, the GENES database now includes viruses, plasmids,
  and the addendum category for functionally characterized proteins that are
  not represented in complete genomes. Third, new automatic annotation servers,
  BlastKOALA and GhostKOALA, are made available utilizing the non-redundant
  pangenome data set generated from the GENES database. As a resource for

    Read alignment is an ongoing challenge for the analysis of data from
  sequencing technologies. This article proposes an elegantly simple multi-seed
  strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping reads to a reference genome. The
  new strategy chooses the mapped genomic location for the read directly from
  the seeds. It uses a relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads)
  extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the optimal
  location. When the read length is {\textless}160 bp, overlapping subreads are
  used. More conventional alignment algorithms are then used to fill in
  detailed mismatch and indel information between the subreads that make up the
  winning voting block. The strategy is fast because the overall genomic
  location has already been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is
  sensitive because no individual subread is required to map exactly, nor are
  individual subreads constrained to map close by other subreads. It is
  accurate because the final location must be supported by several different
  subreads. The strategy extends easily to find exon junctions, by locating
  reads that contain sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same
  gene. It scales up efficiently for longer reads.%

    The sequencing of the full transcriptome (RNA-seq) has become the preferred
  choice for the measurement of genome-wide gene expression. Despite its
  widespread use, challenges remain in RNA-seq data analysis. One
  often-overlooked aspect is normalization. Despite the fact that a variety of
  factors or ‘batch effects' can contribute unwanted variation to the data,
  commonly used RNA-seq normalization methods only correct for sequencing
  depth. The study of gene expression is particularly problematic when it is
  influenced simultaneously by a variety of biological factors in addition to
  the one of interest. Using examples from experimental neuroscience, we show
  that batch effects can dominate the signal of interest; and that the choice
  of normalization method affects the power and reproducibility of the results.
  While commonly used global normalization methods are not able to adequately
  normalize the data, more recently developed RNA-seq normalization can. We
  focus on one particular method, RUVSeq and show that it is able to increase
  power and biological insight of the results. Finally, we provide a tutorial
  outlining the implementation of RUVSeq normalization that is applicable to a
  broad range of studies as well as meta-analysis of publicly available data.%

    BACKGROUND: Finding genes that are differentially expressed between
  conditions is an integral part of understanding the molecular basis of
  phenotypic variation. In the past decades, DNA microarrays have been used
  extensively to quantify the abundance of mRNA corresponding to different
  genes, and more recently high-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) has
  emerged as a powerful competitor. As the cost of sequencing decreases, it is
  conceivable that the use of RNA-seq for differential expression analysis will
  increase rapidly. To exploit the possibilities and address the challenges
  posed by this relatively new type of data, a number of software packages have
  been developed especially for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq
  data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We conducted an extensive comparison
  of eleven methods for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. All
  methods are freely available within the R framework and take as input a
  matrix of counts, i.e. the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature of
  interest in each of a number of samples. We evaluate the methods based on
  both simulated data and real RNA-seq
  data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Very small sample sizes, which
  are still common in RNA-seq experiments, impose problems for all evaluated
  methods and any results obtained under such conditions should be interpreted
  with caution. For larger sample sizes, the methods combining a
  variance-stabilizing transformation with the 'limma' method for differential
  expression analysis perform well under many different conditions, as does the
  nonparametric SAMseq method.%

    BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as the Illumina
  Genome Analyzer, are powerful new tools for investigating a wide range of
  biological and medical questions. Statistical and computational methods are
  key for drawing meaningful and accurate conclusions from the massive and
  complex datasets generated by the sequencers. We provide a detailed
  evaluation of statistical methods for normalization and differential
  expression (DE) analysis of Illumina transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq)
  data. RESULTS: We compare statistical methods for detecting genes that are
  significantly DE between two types of biological samples and find that there
  are substantial differences in how the test statistics handle low-count
  genes. We evaluate how DE results are affected by features of the sequencing
  platform, such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling calibration method
  (with and without phi X control lane), and flow-cell/library preparation
  effects. We investigate the impact of the read count normalization method on
  DE results and show that the standard approach of scaling by total lane
  counts (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We propose more general
  quantile-based normalization procedures and demonstrate an improvement in DE
  detection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results have significant practical and
  methodological implications for the design and analysis of mRNA-Seq
  experiments. They highlight the importance of appropriate statistical methods
  for normalization and DE inference, to account for features of the sequencing
  platform that could impact the accuracy of results. They also reveal the need
  for further research in the development of statistical and computational
  methods for mRNA-Seq.%

    STUDY DESIGN: Propensity score-matched, retrospective cohort study.
  OBJECTIVES: To determine the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in
  patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). SETTING: The present study used
  Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. METHODS: A total of
  9257 patients who had 2 ambulatory visits with a diagnosis of SCI in 2001
  were included in the SCI group. The non-SCI group consisted of 37,028
  propensity score-matched patients without a diagnosis of SCI. The cumulative
  incidence of AD was estimated for each of the two patient groups using the
  Kaplan-Meier method. Stratified Cox proportional hazard regression was then
  employed to assess the influence of SCI on the risk of AD. RESULTS: During
  the follow-up period, 25 subjects in the SCI group and 57 in the non-SCI
  group developed AD. The cumulative incidence of AD in the SCI group was
  higher than in the non-SCI group (P = 0.0168); and the hazard ratio of AD for
  the SCI group, as compared to the non-SCI group, was 1.71 (95{\%} CI
  1.06-2.76, P = 0.0273). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that patients with
  SCI have an increased risk of developing AD.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Disruptions in local chromatin structure often indicate features of
  biological interest such as regulatory regions. We find that sonication of
  cross-linked chromatin, when combined with a size-selection step and
  massively parallel short-read sequencing, can be used as a method (Sono-Seq)
  to map locations of high chromatin accessibility in promoter regions.
  Sono-Seq sites frequently correspond to actively transcribed promoter
  regions, as evidenced by their co-association with RNA Polymerase II ChIP
  regions, transcription start sites, histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation
  (H3K4me3) marks, and CpG islands; signals over other sites, such as those
  bound by the CTCF insulator, are also observed. The pattern of breakage by
  Sono-Seq overlaps with, but is distinct from, that observed for FAIRE and
  DNase I hypersensitive sites. Our results demonstrate that Sono-Seq can be a
  useful and simple method by which to map many local alterations in chromatin
  structure. Furthermore, our results provide insights into the mapping of
  binding sites by using ChIP–Seq experiments and the value of reference
  samples that should be used in such experiments.%

    We present Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq data, MACS, which analyzes data
  generated by short read sequencers such as Solexa's Genome Analyzer. MACS
  empirically models the shift size of ChIP-Seq tags, and uses it to improve
  the spatial resolution of predicted binding sites. MACS also uses a dynamic
  Poisson distribution to effectively capture local biases in the genome,
  allowing for more robust predictions. MACS compares favorably to existing
  ChIP-Seq peak-finding algorithms, and is freely available.%

    BACKGROUND Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput
  sequencing (ChIP-seq) or ChIP followed by genome tiling array analysis
  (ChIP-chip) have become standard technologies for genome-wide identification
  of DNA-binding protein target sites. A number of algorithms have been
  developed in parallel that allow identification of binding sites from
  ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip datasets and subsequent visualization in the University
  of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser as custom annotation tracks.
  However, summarizing these tracks can be a daunting task, particularly if
  there are a large number of binding sites or the binding sites are
  distributed widely across the genome. RESULTS We have developed ChIPpeakAnno
  as a Bioconductor package within the statistical programming environment R to
  facilitate batch annotation of enriched peaks identified from ChIP-seq,
  ChIP-chip, cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) or any experiments
  resulting in a large number of enriched genomic regions. The binding sites
  annotated with ChIPpeakAnno can be viewed easily as a table, a pie chart or
  plotted in histogram form, i.e., the distribution of distances to the nearest
  genes for each set of peaks. In addition, we have implemented functionalities
  for determining the significance of overlap between replicates or binding
  sites among transcription factors within a complex, and for drawing Venn
  diagrams to visualize the extent of the overlap between replicates.
  Furthermore, the package includes functionalities to retrieve sequences
  flanking putative binding sites for PCR amplification, cloning, or motif
  discovery, and to identify Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with adjacent
  genes. CONCLUSIONS ChIPpeakAnno enables batch annotation of the binding sites
  identified from ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip, CAGE or any technology that results in a
  large number of enriched genomic regions within the statistical programming
  environment R. Allowing users to pass their own annotation data such as a
  different Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) preparation and a dataset from
  literature, or existing annotation packages, such as GenomicFeatures and
  BSgenome, provides flexibility. Tight integration to the biomaRt package
  enables up-to-date annotation retrieval from the BioMart database.%

    The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) project was initiated in response to the
  growing demand for a public repository for high-throughput gene expression
  data. GEO provides a flexible and open design that facilitates submission,
  storage and retrieval of heterogeneous data sets from high-throughput gene
  expression and genomic hybridization experiments. GEO is not intended to
  replace in house gene expression databases that benefit from coherent data
  sets, and which are constructed to facilitate a particular analytic method,
  but rather complement these by acting as a tertiary, central data
  distribution hub. The three central data entities of GEO are platforms,
  samples and series, and were designed with gene expression and genomic
  hybridization experiments in mind. A platform is, essentially, a list of
  probes that define what set of molecules may be detected. A sample describes
  the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform
  used to generate its molecular abundance data. A series organizes samples
  into the meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. The GEO repository
  is publicly accessible through the World Wide Web at
  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo.%

    During the last 3 years, a number of approaches for the normalization of
  RNA sequencing data have emerged in the literature, differing both in the
  type of bias adjustment and in the statistical strategy adopted. However, as
  data continue to accumulate, there has been no clear consensus on the
  appropriate normalization method to be used or the impact of a chosen method
  on the downstream analysis. In this work, we focus on a comprehensive
  comparison of seven recently proposed normalization methods for the
  differential analysis of RNA-seq data, with an emphasis on the use of varied
  real and simulated datasets involving different species and experimental
  designs to represent data characteristics commonly observed in practice.
  Based on this comparison study, we propose practical recommendations on the
  appropriate normalization method to be used and its impact on the
  differential analysis of RNA-seq data.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read
  counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the ability to
  analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and
  blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation.
  Biological variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the
  technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical
  Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when
  there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such
  variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the
  Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates
  the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential
  expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression
  changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific
  variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed
  relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions
  de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to
  focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel
  computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting
  faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more
  convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted
  profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological
  variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical
  Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of
  assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods
  developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq
  applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation
  analyses.%

    The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the
  familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point
  out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing
  is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely
  rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent
  to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore,
  in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of
  the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple
  sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery
  rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the
  gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the
  appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.%

    High-throughput data production has revolutionized molecular biology.
  However, massive increases in data generation capacity require analysis
  approaches that are more sophisticated, and often very computationally
  intensive. Thus, making sense of high-throughput data requires informatics
  support. Galaxy (http://galaxyproject.org) is a software system that provides
  this support through a framework that gives experimentalists simple
  interfaces to powerful tools, while automatically managing the computational
  details. Galaxy is distributed both as a publicly available Web service,
  which provides tools for the analysis of genomic, comparative genomic, and
  functional genomic data, or a downloadable package that can be deployed in
  individual laboratories. Either way, it allows experimentalists without
  informatics or programming expertise to perform complex large-scale analysis
  with just a Web browser.%

    BACKGROUND An incremental, loosely planned development approach is often
  used in bioinformatic studies when dealing with custom data analysis in a
  rapidly changing environment. Unfortunately, the lack of a rigorous software
  structuring can undermine the maintainability, communicability and
  replicability of the process. To ameliorate this problem we propose the Leaf
  system, the aim of which is to seamlessly introduce the pipeline formality on
  top of a dynamical development process with minimum overhead for the
  programmer, thus providing a simple layer of software structuring. RESULTS
  Leaf includes a formal language for the definition of pipelines with code
  that can be transparently inserted into the user's Python code. Its syntax is
  designed to visually highlight dependencies in the pipeline structure it
  defines. While encouraging the developer to think in terms of bioinformatic
  pipelines, Leaf supports a number of automated features including data and
  session persistence, consistency checks between steps of the analysis,
  processing optimization and publication of the analytic protocol in the form
  of a hypertext. CONCLUSIONS Leaf offers a powerful balance between
  plan-driven and change-driven development environments in the design,
  management and communication of bioinformatic pipelines. Its unique features
  make it a valuable alternative to other related tools.%

    Reproducibility in Data Analysis research has long been a significant
  concern, particularly in the areas of Bioinformatics and Computational
  Biology. Towards the aim of developing reproducible and reusable processes,
  Data Analysis management tools can help giving structure and coherence to
  complex data flows. Nonetheless, improved software quality comes at the cost
  of additional design and planning effort, which may become impractical in
  rapidly changing development environments. I propose that an adjustment of
  focus from processes to data in the management of Bioinformatic pipelines may
  help improving reproducibility with minimal impact on preexisting development
  practices. In this paper I introduce the repo R package for bioinformatic
  analysis management. The tool supports a data-centered philosophy that aims
  at improving analysis reproducibility and reusability with minimal design
  overhead. The core of repo lies in its support for easy data storage,
  retrieval, distribution and annotation. In repo the data analysis flow is
  derived a posteriori from dependency annotations. The repo package
  constitutes an unobtrusive data and flow management extension of the R
  statistical language. Its adoption, together with good development practices,
  can help improving data analysis management, sharing and reproducibility,

    RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has become an established way for measuring gene
  expression in model organisms and humans. While methods development for
  refining the corresponding data processing and analysis pipeline is ongoing,
  protocols for typical steps have been proposed and are widely used. Several
  user interfaces have been developed for making such analysis steps accessible
  to life scientists without extensive knowledge of command line tools. We
  performed a systematic search and evaluation of such interfaces to
  investigate to what extent these can indeed facilitate RNA-seq data analysis.
  We found a total of 29 open source interfaces, and six of the more widely
  used interfaces were evaluated in detail. Central criteria for evaluation
  were ease of configuration, documentation, usability, computational demand
  and reporting. No interface scored best in all of these criteria, indicating
  that the final choice will depend on the specific perspective of users and
  the corresponding weighting of criteria. Considerable technical hurdles had
  to be overcome in our evaluation. For many users, this will diminish
  potential benefits compared with command line tools, leaving room for future
  improvement of interfaces.%

    Innovations in biomedical research technologies continue to provide
  experimental biologists with novel and increasingly large genomic and
  high-throughput data resources to be analyzed. As creating and obtaining data
  has become easier, the key decision faced by many researchers is a practical
  one: where and how should an analysis be performed? Datasets are large and
  analysis tool set-up and use is riddled with complexities outside of the
  scope of core research activities. The authors believe that Galaxy
  (galaxyproject.org) provides a powerful solution that simplifies data
  acquisition and analysis in an intuitive web-application, granting all
  researchers access to key informatics tools previously only available to
  computational specialists working in Unix-based environments. We will
  demonstrate through a series of biomedically relevant protocols how Galaxy
  specifically brings together 1) data retrieval from public and private
  sources, for example, UCSC's Eukaryote and Microbial Genome Browsers
  (genome.ucsc.edu), 2) custom tools (wrapped Unix functions, format
  standardization/conversions, interval operations) and 3rd party analysis
  tools, for example, Bowtie/Tuxedo Suite (bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net), Lastz
  (www.bx.psu.edu/{\~{}}rsharris/lastz/), SAMTools (samtools.sourceforge.net),
  FASTX-toolkit (hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx{\_}toolkit), and MACS
  (liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MACS), and creates results formatted for
  visualization in tools such as the Galaxy Track Browser (GTB,
  galaxyproject.org/wiki/Learn/Visualization), UCSC Genome Browser
  (genome.ucsc.edu), Ensembl (www.ensembl.org), and GeneTrack
  (genetrack.bx.psu.edu)., Galaxy rapidly has become the most popular choice
  for integrated next generation sequencing (NGS) analytics and collaboration,
  where users can perform, document, and share complex analysis within a single
  interface in an unprecedented number of ways.%

    The Taverna workflow tool suite (http://www.taverna.org.uk) is designed to
  combine distributed Web Services and/or local tools into complex analysis
  pipelines. These pipelines can be executed on local desktop machines or
  through larger infrastructure (such as supercomputers, Grids or cloud
  environments), using the Taverna Server. In bioinformatics, Taverna workflows
  are typically used in the areas of high-throughput omics analyses (for
  example, proteomics or transcriptomics), or for evidence gathering methods
  involving text mining or data mining. Through Taverna, scientists have access
  to several thousand different tools and resources that are freely available
  from a large range of life science institutions. Once constructed, the
  workflows are reusable, executable bioinformatics protocols that can be
  shared, reused and repurposed. A repository of public workflows is available
  at http://www.myexperiment.org. This article provides an update to the
  Taverna tool suite, highlighting new features and developments in the
  workbench and the Taverna Server.%

    Chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq)
  is widely used to identify binding sites for a target protein in the genome.
  An important scientific application is to identify changes in protein binding
  between different treatment conditions, i.e. to detect differential binding.
  This can reveal potential mechanisms through which changes in binding may
  contribute to the treatment effect. The csaw package provides a framework for
  the de novo detection of differentially bound genomic regions. It uses a
  window-based strategy to summarize read counts across the genome. It exploits
  existing statistical software to test for significant differences in each
  window. Finally, it clusters windows into regions for output and controls the
  false discovery rate properly over all detected regions. The csaw package can
  handle arbitrarily complex experimental designs involving biological
  replicates. It can be applied to both transcription factor and histone mark
  datasets, and, more generally, to any type of sequencing data measuring
  genomic coverage. csaw performs favorably against existing methods for de
  novo DB analyses on both simulated and real data. csaw is implemented as a R
  software package and is freely available from the open-source Bioconductor
  project.%

    Functional enrichment analysis is a key step in interpreting gene lists
  discovered in diverse high-throughput experiments. g:Profiler studies flat
  and ranked gene lists and finds statistically significant Gene Ontology
  terms, pathways and other gene function related terms. Translation of
  hundreds of gene identifiers is another core feature of g:Profiler. Since its
  first publication in 2007, our web server has become a popular tool of choice
  among basic and translational researchers. Timeliness is a major advantage of
  g:Profiler as genome and pathway information is synchronized with the Ensembl
  database in quarterly updates. g:Profiler supports 213 species including
  mammals and other vertebrates, plants, insects and fungi. The 2016 update of
  g:Profiler introduces several novel features. We have added further
  functional datasets to interpret gene lists, including transcription factor
  binding site predictions, Mendelian disease annotations, information about
  protein expression and complexes and gene mappings of human genetic
  polymorphisms. Besides the interactive web interface, g:Profiler can be
  accessed in computational pipelines using our R package, Python interface and
  BioJS component. g:Profiler is freely available at
  http://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/.%

    BACKGROUND: Gene set analysis is moving towards considering pathway
  topology as a crucial feature. Pathway elements are complex entities such as
  protein complexes, gene family members and chemical compounds. The conversion
  of pathway topology to a gene/protein networks (where nodes are a simple
  element like a gene/protein) is a critical and challenging task that enables
  topology-based gene set analyses.Unfortunately, currently available
  R/Bioconductor packages provide pathway networks only from single databases.
  They do not propagate signals through chemical compounds and do not
  differentiate between complexes and gene families.RESULTS: Here we present
  graphite, a Bioconductor package addressing these issues. Pathway information
  from four different databases is interpreted following specific
  biologically-driven rules that allow the reconstruction of gene-gene networks
  taking into account protein complexes, gene families and sensibly removing
  chemical compounds from the final graphs. The resulting networks represent a
  uniform resource for pathway analyses. Indeed, graphite provides easy access
  to three recently proposed topological methods. The graphite package is
  available as part of the Bioconductor software suite.CONCLUSIONS: graphite is
  an innovative package able to gather and make easily available the contents
  of the four major pathway databases. In the field of topological analysis
  graphite acts as a provider of biological information by reducing the pathway
  complexity considering the biological meaning of the pathway elements%
