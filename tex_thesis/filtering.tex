Low expressed genes in \textit{RNA-Seq} data, always affect the detection of \glspl{deg} \cite{Sha2015} influencing final results.

In order to addres this task, \gls{tic} offers multiple statistical methods for low counts filtering low expressed genes.
There are two main functions which enables to filter out unwanted genes. 
We implemened the \lstinline!filterLowCounts! methods which is partly based on the \lstinline!filtered.data! function of \textit{NOISeq} R/Bioconductor package. 
We gives the possibility to apply four different filtering methods, the \gls{cpm}, the {proportion} and the \textit{Wilcoxon} tests and an our-defined method names \textit{quantile}.

The \gls{cpm} filters out all those genes with a mean expression between the samples less than the \lstinline!cpm! parameter threshold and, at the same time, a \gls{cov} higher that the \lstinline!cv.percentage! parameter in all the samples.

The \textit{Proportion} test performs the homonym test on the counts, filtering out all the features with a relative expression equal to $cpm/10^6$.

While, the \textit{Wilcoxon} test filters out all those genes with a median equal to $0$.

Finally the quantile method enables to filter out all those genes which express a mean counts between all the samples higher that the \lstinline!quantile.threshold! argument.
